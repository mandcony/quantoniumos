# Q-Vault: Secure File Encryption Suite

Quantum-inspired secure file storage and encryption system.

## Components

- **`q_vault.py`** - Main vault application with RFT-based encryption
- **`launch_q_vault.py`** - Launcher script for Q-Vault

## Features

- RFT-based file encryption
- Secure key derivation using golden ratio parameters
- Integration with quantum-inspired algorithms
- File integrity verification
- Encrypted metadata storage

## Security

Q-Vault uses quantum-inspired cryptographic primitives:
- RFT transform-based key expansion
- Golden ratio parameterized encryption
- Vertex-based state encoding
- Cryptographic hash verification

## Usage

```bash
python launch_q_vault.py    # Launch Q-Vault GUI
python q_vault.py          # Direct vault access
```
