### How to Fix Your Deployment ###

I've analyzed the error and identified that your Replit deployment is having issues connecting.
Here are the steps to fix it:

1. I created a new simplified `app.py` file to make deployment more reliable
2. I created a `fix_deployment.py` script to help troubleshoot

## FIRST: Update your .replit configuration

Go to your Replit project, click on the "Secrets" tool in the left panel, and do the following:

1. Click on the "Project Settings" (gear icon) in the lower left
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. In the deployment configuration, change:
   - Change "Command" to: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app`
   - Change "Deployment platform" to: "Cloud Run"

4. Click Save/Update deployment settings

## THEN: Run the fix script

In the Replit Shell, run:
```
python fix_deployment.py
```

## FINALLY: Deploy again

1. Click "Stop" on the current deployment
2. Click "Deploy" to create a new deployment
3. After deployment completes, try accessing your app again

## ADDITIONAL CHECKS

If it still doesn't work after redeploying:
- Try accessing: https://quantum-shield-luisminier79.replit.app/health
- Try accessing: https://quantum-shield-luisminier79.replit.app/deployment-test

These endpoints are designed to help diagnose deployment issues.

## IF YOU HAVE A CUSTOM DOMAIN

If you're using a custom domain, make sure:
1. Your DNS settings are correct (A record pointing to Replit's IP)
2. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation to complete
