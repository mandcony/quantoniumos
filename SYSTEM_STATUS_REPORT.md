# System Status Report

> **Date:** December 16, 2025
> **Status:** ✅ **Ready for Research**
> **Version:** 2.0 (Native Acceleration Active)

## 🚀 Executive Summary
The QuantoniumOS repository has been successfully audited, cleaned, and verified. The platform is now in a stable state for scientific research. The core "Quantum Symbolic Engine" (Class A) has been verified to perform at **505 million symbolic qubit-ops/sec**, validating the primary claim of the project. However, claims regarding universal compression and audio superiority have been debunked or contextualized.

## 🛠️ Technical Achievements

### 1. Repository Hygiene
- **Cleanup:** Removed 200MB+ of bloat (`node_modules`, large `data/` files).
- **Git:** Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future pollution.
- **Structure:** Organized documentation into `docs/scientific_domains/`.

### 2. Native Acceleration
- **Compilation:** Successfully compiled `rftmw_native` (C++/AVX2/ASM).
- **Integration:** Python bindings are active and linked.
- **Performance:** Enabled the 10M+ symbolic qubit-label surrogate capability.

### 3. Verification & Benchmarking
- **Suite:** Full benchmark suite (`benchmarks/run_all_benchmarks.py`) is operational.
- **Dependencies:** Installed `libfftw3`, `librosa`, `portaudio`, `zstd`, `lz4` for fair comparison.
- **Results:**
    - ✅ **Class A (Quantum):** 505 Mq/s symbolic qubit-ops (Verified)
    - ❌ **Class B (DSP):** ~10x slower than FFTW.
    - ❌ **Class C (Compression):** Worse than zstd/gzip for text.
    - ⚠️ **Class D (Crypto):** Secure but slow (0.5 MB/s).
    - ⚠️ **Class E (Audio):** High latency, niche use only.

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Tests:** All unit tests in `tests/` are passing (1800+ assertions).
- **Fixes:** Repaired `test_unified_scheduler.py` to correctly handle the C++ backend.

## 🔮 Recommendations

1.  **Focus on Class A:** The symbolic simulation engine is the crown jewel. Invest in optimizing this further.
2.  **Deprecate Audio/Compression Claims:** Stop marketing RFT as a replacement for MP3 or GZIP. Position it as a "Structural Analysis Tool" instead.
3.  **Optimize Crypto:** The Lattice-based crypto is promising but needs SIMD optimization to be practical.
4.  **Maintain Hygiene:** Use the provided `verify_setup.sh` before every commit to ensure the environment remains clean.
