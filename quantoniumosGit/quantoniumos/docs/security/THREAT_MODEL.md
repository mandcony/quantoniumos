# QuantoniumOS Threat Model

This document outlines the threat model for the QuantoniumOS project, following the STRIDE methodology.

## 1. External Threats

### 1.1. Spoofing Identity
- **Threat Actor:** Malicious clients, external services.
- **Threat:** An attacker could impersonate a valid user or service to gain unauthorized access to the API.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **JWT Authentication:** All API endpoints are protected by JWTs. The `jwt_auth.py` module enforces validation of the token signature, expiration, and issuer.
    - **Strict `kid` Enforcement:** The system uses a key identifier (`kid`) in the JWT header to select the correct public key for verification. This prevents substitution attacks. Keys are rotated periodically.
    - **Secure Key Storage:** Private keys are managed by `auth/secret_manager.py` and are not exposed.

### 1.2. Tampering with Data
- **Threat Actor:** Attackers on the network (MitM), malicious clients.
- **Threat:** An attacker could modify data in transit between the client and server, or attempt to submit malformed data to corrupt the system state.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **TLS Encryption:** All communication is over HTTPS, enforced by the production web server (Gunicorn/Nginx).
    - **HMAC-SHA256 in Geometric Waveform Hash:** The `geometric_waveform_hash` uses HMAC-SHA256 to ensure data integrity for hashed values.
    - **Pydantic Validation:** All incoming API data is strictly validated against Pydantic models defined in `models.py`. This prevents data tampering and injection attacks at the application layer.
    - **Immutable Data Structures:** Where possible, the system prefers immutable data structures to prevent unintended side effects.

### 1.3. Repudiation
- **Threat Actor:** Legitimate users who wish to deny their actions.
- **Threat:** A user could perform a sensitive action (e.g., deleting data) and later deny having done so.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **Audit Logging:** (Future work) Implement comprehensive audit logging for all sensitive API calls, recording the user identity (from JWT), timestamp, and action performed.
    - **Immutable Ledgers:** (Future work) For critical operations, consider using a cryptographically secure ledger to record transactions.

### 1.4. Information Disclosure
- **Threat Actor:** Attackers, malicious clients, insiders.
- **Threat:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information, such as user data, system secrets, or proprietary algorithms.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The system is designed to expose only the necessary information through its API.
    - **Secrets Management:** All secrets (API keys, JWT secrets) are managed via environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), handled by `auth/secret_manager.py`.
    - **Restricted File Permissions:** Production deployment scripts should ensure that sensitive files (e.g., private keys) have strict file permissions.
    - **Seccomp Profile:** The Docker container is restricted by a `seccomp.json` profile, limiting the system calls the application can make and reducing the kernel's attack surface.

### 1.5. Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Threat Actor:** Malicious actors, botnets.
- **Threat:** An attacker could flood the service with requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **Rate Limiting:** (Future work) Implement rate limiting on the API gateway or within the application to block IPs that exceed a certain number of requests in a given time frame.
    - **Resource-Intensive Operation Protection:** The quantum simulation endpoints are computationally expensive. Access should be restricted to authenticated and authorized users.
    - **Gunicorn Worker Management:** Gunicorn is configured to manage a pool of workers, providing resilience against traffic spikes. The use of `gevent` workers helps handle I/O-bound requests efficiently.
    - **Redis Command Security:** The `redis_config.py` module explicitly disables dangerous commands like `FLUSHDB` and `FLUSHALL` in production to prevent accidental or malicious data wipes.

### 1.6. Elevation of Privilege
- **Threat Actor:** Malicious users, attackers who have compromised a low-privilege account.
- **Threat:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability to gain higher privileges than they were assigned.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The application logic is separated from the authentication and authorization logic.
    - **Scoped JWTs:** (Future work) JWTs can be issued with specific scopes (e.g., `read:data`, `run:simulation`) to limit the actions a user can perform.
    - **Containerization:** The application runs in a Docker container as a non-root user, limiting its access to the host system.

## 2. Internal Threats

### 2.1. Malicious Insider
- **Threat Actor:** A developer or administrator with legitimate access.
- **Threat:** An insider could intentionally introduce vulnerabilities, backdoor the code, or exfiltrate data.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **Code Reviews:** All code changes must go through a pull request and be reviewed by at least one other developer.
    - **CI/CD Security Scans:** The CI pipeline includes automated security scanning (Bandit), linting (Ruff), and type checking (Mypy) to catch potential issues.
    - **Access Controls:** Access to the production environment and secrets is restricted to a small number of authorized personnel.

## 3. Next Steps & Future Work

- **Implement Audit Logging:** Introduce a robust logging mechanism for all security-sensitive events.
- **Implement Rate Limiting:** Add a rate-limiting solution to protect against DoS attacks.
- **Introduce JWT Scopes:** Enhance the authorization model with fine-grained permissions using JWT scopes.
- **Formalize Incident Response Plan:** Document a clear plan for responding to security incidents.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic third-party security audits and penetration tests.
