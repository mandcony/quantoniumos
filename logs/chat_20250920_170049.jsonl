{"type": "assistant", "ts": "2025-09-20T17:01:17", "text": "⚛️ Quantum computing uses quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. Instead of just 0s and 1s, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for exponentially more computational possibilities. It's especially powerful for certain problems like cryptography, optimization, and simulation.", "confidence": 0.96}
