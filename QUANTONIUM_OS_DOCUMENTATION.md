# QuantoniumOS Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

QuantoniumOS is a cutting-edge quantum computing visualization and simulation platform that provides secure, interactive interfaces for exploring quantum computational concepts. The system implements a quantum-inspired container validation system using hash values as cryptographic keys to unlock specific encrypted containers.

### Core Components

1. **Resonance Encryption Engine**
   - Proprietary waveform resonance matching technology
   - Each encryption operation creates a unique container with its generated hash
   - Only the specific hash can unlock its corresponding container
   - Advanced avalanche effect properties for cryptographic strength

2. **Quantum Grid Visualization**
   - Simulates computation targeting 100-150 qubits
   - Real-time visualization of quantum states
   - Supports grid alignment and rotation for multi-dimensional observation

3. **Symbolic Container System**
   - Hash/ciphertext duality: Hash and ciphertext are intentionally the same
   - Provides both identification and encoded representation
   - Metadata includes author_id, timestamp, parent_hash, and cryptographic signature
   - Wave Coherence (WC) tamper detection system

4. **Security Framework**
   - Wave HMAC authentication combines traditional HMAC-SHA256 with resonance phase information
   - Frontend validation layer with strict backend controls
   - All proprietary algorithms run securely on backend with no frontend access
   - Comprehensive 64-Perturbation Benchmark for cryptographic validation

## Key Features

- Network connection to API endpoints

## Security Considerations

1. All proprietary algorithms run exclusively on the backend
2. Frontend has no direct access to core algorithms
3. All API calls are authenticated and rate-limited
4. Wave HMAC provides quantum-resistant authentication
5. The system has undergone extensive security validation testing

## Patent Claims Validation

This implementation validates the following patent claims:

1. **Claim 1**: Bidirectional Resonance Fourier Transform with perfect roundtrip fidelity
2. **Claim 2**: Geometric waveform hash with secure wave parameter encoding
3. **Claim 3**: Wave coherence (WC) tamper detection system
4. **Claim 4**: 64-Perturbation Benchmark for avalanche verification 
5. **Claim 5**: Container metadata provenance tracking system

## Benchmark Interpretation Guide

The 64-Perturbation Benchmark runs a series of tests to validate the cryptographic properties:

1. **Base Test**: Establishes baseline measurements for reference
2. **Plaintext Bit Flips**: 32 tests with single bit changes to input
3. **Key Bit Flips**: 31 tests with single bit changes to the key
4. **Metrics**:
   - **Harmonic Ratio (HR)**: Measures frequency domain changes
   - **Waveform Coherence (WC)**: Measures amplitude and phase alignment
   - **Avalanche Score**: Combined metric of cryptographic strength
   - **Bit Change Percentage**: Proportion of output bits affected by input changes

Ideal results show approximately 50% bit changes for any single-bit input modification.

## Troubleshooting

1. If container unlock fails with "Access denied", this is expected behavior for unauthorized access attempts.
2. If quantum grid initialization fails, check that qubit count is between 1-150.
3. If benchmark visualization does not display, ensure the API is properly returning CSV results.
4. For Wave HMAC verification failures, check that the original key is being used.
