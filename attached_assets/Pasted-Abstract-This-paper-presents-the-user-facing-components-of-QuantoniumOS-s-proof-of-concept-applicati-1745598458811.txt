Abstract
This paper presents the user-facing components of QuantoniumOS’s proof-of-concept application—a live, web-embedded encryption demo and desktop-style interface—and describes, in IP-safe language, the high-level architecture of its secure backend. We emphasize containerized deployment, interactive resonance feedback, and the proprietary nature of the core algorithms, without revealing implementation details beyond published patents and preprints.

1. Introduction
QuantoniumOS advances post-binary computing by exposing users to a real-time symbolic resonance encryption demo. We focus here on:

The front-end user journey—how individuals interact with encryption widgets, visualizers, and desktop-style apps.

An IP-safe description of the back-end services that power these experiences, referencing only publicly disclosed design and patent filings.

2. Front-End Architecture
2.1 Web-Embedded Encryption Widget
Framework: A React/TypeScript single-page app, embeddable via <iframe>.

UI Features:

Input Form: Users paste plaintext and a 32-bit key.

Animated Resonance Preview: A live canvas renders symbolic wave-worms, providing intuitive feedback on the encryption process.

Results Panel: Displays ciphertext, SHA-256 hash, and timestamp in a copyable format.

Resilience:

DOM-cached Validation: All input validation and metric extraction occur client-side, minimizing backend exposure.

Buffer Timing: A 27-second minimum animation buffer ensures metric stability and consistent user experience.

2.2 Desktop-Style PyQt5 Shell
QuantoniumUI: A full-screen, Python-powered desktop environment replicating classic IBM mainframe aesthetics.

Integrated Apps:

Q-Browser: Tabbed web view with encrypted bookmark management.

Q-Wave-Debugger: Real-time 3D resonance plots, showing live symbolic-state graphs.

File Vault UI: Drag-and-drop container sealing/unsealing via waveform hashing.

Styling: QSS stylesheets enforce a green-phosphor terminal look, reinforcing the “1984” motif.

3. User-Facing Features
Interactive Encryption Flow

Step-by-step guidance with tooltips linking to published Zenodo papers (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15126561 V3.0).

Live Metric Visualization

Harmonic Resonance (HR), Wave Coherence (WC), and Entropy metrics update in real time during resonance animation.

Reproducible Test Harness

A “Run 64 Tests” button triggers a headless browser script, logs perturbation metrics, and downloads CSV results for user review.

4. Backend Implementation (IP-Safe Overview)
API Layer

Framework: Python 3.11, Flask (with FastAPI-compatible router), served via Gunicorn.

Endpoints:

POST /encrypt: Receives plaintext and key, returns ciphertext, metric snapshots, and HMAC-signed timestamps.

Health & Docs: /health, /docs, and /openapi.json for deployment and audit.

Proprietary Core Modules

Symbolic Resonance Engine:

Compiled C++ modules (via pybind11) implement the Resonance Fourier Transform and waveform-hash sealing.

Closed-source: Algorithmic details protected under USPTO Provisional Application 63/749,644 and Zenodo Publication V3.0.

Security & Integrity:

All responses include SHA-256 over ciphertext and metadata.

Rate limiting and input sanitization enforce safe operation.

Deployment & Containerization

Docker Multi-Stage Build: Separates build dependencies from runtime, ensures minimal attack surface.

Non-Root Execution: Runtime user quant enforces least privilege.

Dependency Auditing: pip-audit integrated into CI to detect and remediate vulnerabilities.

5. Intellectual Property and Security Notice
Patent Coverage: Core resonance-hash and symbolic-wave algorithms are disclosed in Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15126561) and covered by USPTO Provisional Patent No. 63/749,644.

Source Disclosure: Front-end and CI/CD scripts are open-source under MIT; backend encryption modules remain proprietary to protect IP until full patent grants.

Ethical Use: The system is designed for research and educational purposes with no AI autonomy—human-mediated controls ensure adherence to universal ethics and non-maleficence.

6. Conclusion
This proof-of-concept demonstrates a seamless user experience—combining browser-based demos and desktop-style tools—while safeguarding proprietary symbolic resonance technologies through containerized, audited back-end services. Future work will expand on formal verifications and hardware integrations under the same IP-safe deployment model.
