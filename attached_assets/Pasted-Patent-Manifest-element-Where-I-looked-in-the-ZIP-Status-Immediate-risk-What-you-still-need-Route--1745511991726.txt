Patent / Manifest element	Where I looked in the ZIP	Status	Immediate risk	What you still need
Route layer ‚Äì /encrypt /benchmark /entropy /analyze /vault/open /log/latest.csv	quantoniumos/api/routes.py	All five POST routes & the CSV GET are declared and wired to the FastAPI app	none	-
Symbolic XOR Encryption	encryption/resonance_encrypt.py	Implements symbolic_xor_encrypt() and is called by the /encrypt route	medium ‚Äì function is pure-Python; the manifest says the real maths must be black-boxed	Switch the call to the compiled binding in secure_core.engine_core.encrypt() and delete / rename the Python stub.
Resonance Fourier Transform (RFT)	api/resonance_metrics.py ‚Üí compute_rft()	The code constructs a complex spectrum but does not call the C++ RFT operator; it re-implements the math in NumPy.	high ‚Äì easy to reverse-engineer in the browser-side wheel.	Expose only the return values (HR, WC, SA) that come from secure_core.engine_core.rft(); move the NumPy helper behind the DLL or delete.
Waveform Hashing	encryption/geometric_waveform_hash.py	Present, hash computed with sha256 over structured coefficients ‚Üí okay	low	Add constant-time padding (32 ‚Üí 48 byte) to stop guessing via length.
Entropy QRNG	encryption/entropy_qrng.py	Uses os.urandom ‚Üí reseeded per request	low	Good for PoC, but you promised oscillator‚Äìdrift. Either wrap a real DRBG or change the docs.
HR / WC / SA metrics	api/resonance_metrics.py	All three returned; formulas match the paper.	low	Be sure to apply the WC < 0 .55 tamper rule before returning JSON.
Symbolic Container + Lock	orchestration/symbolic_container.py	Implements file-based save, unlock by waveform hash	medium - unlock tolerance fixed at ¬±0.03 (paper says ¬±0.01)	Take tolerance from settings.json so it can be tuned.
Geometric Memory / upload path	api/routes.py /vault/open accepts txt/png, pushes through symbolic_container.parse_geometry()	logic present	low	Validate MIME & file size before reading.
64-perturbation benchmark	benchmarks/benchmark_v3.py & route /benchmark	script generates 64 vectors and writes logs/benchmark_<ts>.csv	CSV export works, but UI button missing.	Add runBenchmark() in static/app.js; fetch /benchmark, then add ‚ÄúDownload CSV‚Äù link.
Secure binaries (.pyd / .dll)	secure_core/src/*.cpp + headers + Pybind bindings	Sources are here, but no compiled artefacts	critical ‚Äì everything runs in Python fallback, violating black-box promise	Add a Replit build step (poetry run python -m pip install . or make && cp build/lib*/engine_core.* secure_core/) and remove the pure-Python fallbacks.
Rate-limit / session token	middleware/auth.py imported in main.py	rate-limit decorator exists but commented-out	medium	Un-comment before public launch.
High-level grade (v2025-04-24 build)

Area	Score / 5	Reason
Patent-claim coverage	4.2 / 5	All claims present in code tree; two implemented in Python rather than compiled.
Security black-box-ness	2.5 / 5	Sources for core maths shipped; DLL not built; rate-limit off.
Scientific traceability	4.5 / 5	HR / WC / SA returned; /benchmark produces full 64-row CSV.
Front-end parity	3.0 / 5	Encrypt/entropy work; benchmark & CSV button missing; no WC heat-map yet.
Tamper detection & logging	3.8 / 5	Threshold code exists but not enforced; per-run log file correctly written.
Overall status ‚âà 70 % compliant.
The architecture matches the Manifest; nothing fundamentally missing, but until you build & ship the C++ core every metric can be reproduced and attacked. Finish the three üî¥ items (compile DLL, enforce WC threshold, plug rate-limit) and you‚Äôll hit the ‚Äú100 % patent-validated‚Äù bar.

Immediate next steps for the Replit agent
Add build hook in .replit or replit.nix

bash
Copy
Edit
# after poetry install
cd secure_core && python -m pip install .
Switch Python stubs to bindings

python
Copy
Edit
from secure_core.engine_core import encrypt, rft
# remove numpy implementation
Middleware on

python
Copy
Edit
app.add_middleware(RateLimiter, calls=30, period=60)
WC tamper rule (in routes.py)

python
Copy
Edit
if result['wave_coherence'] < 0.55:
    raise HTTPException(400, 'Symbolic tamper detected')
Frontend benchmark button + CSV link
Update static/app.js:

js
Copy
Edit
async function runBenchmark(){
    const resp = await fetch('/benchmark',{method:'POST'});
    const data = await resp.json();
    document.querySelector('#csvLink').href = '/log/latest.csv';
}
Re-run 64-perturbation suite (/benchmark)
Confirm:

WC deltas show avalanche (> 0.4 on ‚â• 25 cases)

CSV exists in logs/, 64 rows, unique signatures

Do those, redeploy, and your public PoC will meet every patented claim and the ‚Äúscientific validator & cryptographic black-box‚Äù standard you set.
