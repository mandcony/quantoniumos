# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in QuantoniumOS, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** security reports to: luisminier79@gmail.com
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Provide** steps to reproduce the issue if possible

### Response Time

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days  
- **Security Fix**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

## Security Features

### Database Security
- All database connections use environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`)
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- PostgreSQL with proper connection pooling
- Input validation and sanitization

### Authentication & Authorization
- Production deployments should implement proper authentication
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (minimum 12 rounds)
- Implement JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Enable 2FA for administrative access

### Network Security
- All production traffic should use HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Use CORS policies appropriate for your deployment
- Consider implementing CSP headers

### Environment Security
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Rotate secrets regularly in production
- Use secrets management systems for production

## Production Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Database connection secured with SSL
- [ ] Authentication system implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS certificates installed
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Logging and monitoring enabled

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Regular security updates applied
- [ ] Monitor for unusual activity
- [ ] Regular backup procedures
- [ ] Security audit logs reviewed
- [ ] Penetration testing performed
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning automated

## Responsible Use

### Academic Research
- QuantoniumOS is designed for legitimate quantum computing research
- Please cite our work appropriately (see ACADEMIC_CITATION.md)
- Report any security findings to help improve the system

### Commercial Use

- Geometric waveform hashing algorithms are patent-protected
- Proprietary resonance encryption methods are confidential
- Commercial use requires licensing agreement
- Academic use permitted under open-source terms

## Security Updates

We provide security updates for:
- **Current Version**: Full security support
- **Previous Version**: Critical security fixes only
- **Older Versions**: No security support (upgrade recommended)
