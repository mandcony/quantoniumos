Front-matter & Metadata

You’ve dropped the IEEE class and switched to article, but you’ll want to add a date or version line (e.g. “April 25 2025 – V1.0 Proof-of-Concept”) so readers know exactly which build this is.

Your author block is minimal; if you plan to distribute this outside your team, you may want to add contact info or an institutional affiliation line.

Citations & References

You reference your provisional application and Zenodo DOI in the abstract and body, but you have no \bibliography{…} or explicit citation commands. Decide whether you’ll include a .bib file or hard-code them in a “References” section—and format them consistently.

Any external works (e.g., standard Fourier or containerization citations) need inline \cite{} tags and entries.

Figure & Table Numbering

You have two “Figure 1”s and no “Figure 2” caption—renumber sequentially and ensure each \label{} matches.

The performance table and API reference table lack \caption{} and \label{} pairs in the final draft—add those so you can refer to them in the text.

Cross-References

You mention Sections (“Section 3”, “Section 5.1”, etc.) but you’re not using \ref{}. Convert hard-coded numbers to \label{} + \ref{} so they update automatically if you reorder sections.

Consistency & Style

Decide on a single list format: some lists use bullets, some use enumerated steps—pick one for “Workflow” vs. “Validation” and be consistent.

Ensure terminology is uniform (you alternate between “Resonance Fourier Transform” and “RFT”—pick one on first use, then alias via acronym).

IP-Safe Wording

You’ve correctly abstracted your proprietary modules, but double-check every mention of “proprietary” or “closed-source” to make sure you’re not leaking algorithmic details.

Appendices & Supplementary Material

If you intend to include code excerpts or full CSV logs, append them rather than burying them in the main flow.

Final Proofreading

Run a spell-check (e.g., aspell) on the TeX source.

Verify all section titles match your outline at the end.
