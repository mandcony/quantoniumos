# Quantonium OS Security Hardening - Phase 2: API Attack-Surface Hardening

## Overview

Phase 2 of the security hardening project focuses on strengthening the API attack surface of the Quantonium OS platform. This phase implements comprehensive security middleware, headers, and protection mechanisms to defend against common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Security Middleware

- **Flask-Talisman** for HSTS and Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Enforces HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - Implements a strong default CSP with 'self' source directive
  - Prevents content being loaded in frames (clickjacking protection)
  - Enables secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure flags)

- **Flask-Limiter** for Rate Limiting
  - Restricts requests to 60 per minute per client IP address
  - Applies rate limiting to all routes except the health check endpoint
  - Uses configurable key function (get_remote_address) for client identification
  - Protects against brute force and DoS attacks

### 2. Enhanced Security Headers

- **Comprehensive Header Protection**:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
  - `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` - Prevents leaking referrer information
  - `Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()` - Disables FLoC/Topics tracking
  - Content Security Policy headers with strict defaults

### 3. CORS Implementation

- **Origin-Based Access Control**:
  - Reads allowed origins from `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
  - Rejects cross-origin requests from unauthorized domains with 403 Forbidden
  - Provides flexible configuration through comma-separated origin list
  - Enables legitimate cross-origin access while blocking unauthorized requests

### 4. Health Check Endpoint

- Added `/api/health` endpoint that:
  - Returns simple JSON status information
  - Is exempt from rate limiting
  - Provides application monitoring capabilities
  - Follows API best practices with consistent JSON format

## Security Benefits

These enhancements provide the following security benefits:

1. **Protection Against Web Attacks**: CSP and security headers defend against XSS, clickjacking, and injection attacks.

2. **Prevention of Brute Force Attacks**: Rate limiting prevents credential stuffing and other brute force attacks.

3. **Origin Protection**: CORS implementation prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests.

4. **Transport Security**: HSTS ensures secure connections and prevents downgrade attacks.

5. **Resource Protection**: Rate limiting prevents DoS attacks by limiting request volume.

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows web security best practices:

- Clear separation of security configuration in dedicated module
- Environment-based configuration for flexibility
- Comprehensive test coverage of security features
- Non-intrusive integration with existing application code

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage has been implemented for all security features:

- Security header validation
- Rate limiting configuration verification
- CORS implementation tests
- Health check endpoint validation
- Content Security Policy verification

## Next Steps

While Phase 2 has significantly improved the API attack surface security of Quantonium OS, future phases will address:

- Audit and monitoring capabilities
- Authentication and authorization improvements
- Container registry security
- Runtime protection enhancements
