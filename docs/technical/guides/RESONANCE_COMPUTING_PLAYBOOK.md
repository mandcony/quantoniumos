# Resonance Computing Playbook

This guide shows how to put the Resonance Fourier Transform (RFT) stack to work in a tangible workflow, highlights the "aha" moment behind QuantoniumOS, and explains how the subsystems fit together to deliver behaviour you cannot get from conventional transforms or classical hashing/encryption alone.

## The resonance "aha" moment

* **Golden-ratio kernel synthesis.** `CanonicalTrueRFT` builds its unitary basis by blending a φ-sequenced phase lattice with Gaussian proximity weights and explicit QR orthonormalisation, so every column of Ψ carries both spatial adjacency and incommensurate phase structure.【F:algorithms/rft/core/canonical_true_rft.py†L18-L75】
* **Phase-aware hashing.** `GeometricWaveformHash` pushes byte streams through the same RFT engine before performing deterministic manifold projection and topological embedding, keeping geometric relations intact instead of collapsing them into raw digests.【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L27-L171】
* **Resonance-governed crypto.** `EnhancedRFTCryptoV2` derives per-round keys, phase locks, amplitude masks, and keyed diffusion matrices from φ-parameterised HKDF phases, making each round sensitive to the resonance spectrum instead of fixed S-box tables alone.【F:algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py†L1-L170】

Taken together, the system lets you build pipelines where compression, hashing, and encryption share the same resonance geometry—RFT basis vectors, manifold projections, and keyed diffusion all speak the same language.

## Case study workflow – shipping a verifiable model update

**Problem.** You need to ship a research model update to a remote collaborator with three guarantees: (1) the checkpoint can be reconstructed exactly, (2) tampering is obvious, and (3) the payload stays confidential during transit. Here is how QuantoniumOS solves it end-to-end.

1. **Boot the resonance stack.** `quantonium_boot.py` checks Python dependencies, compiles the resonance assembly engines if needed, validates the core algorithms, and launches the services, so every downstream step runs against a consistent RFT kernel.【F:quantonium_boot.py†L1-L199】
2. **Compress the checkpoint with the vertex codec.** Use `encode_state_dict` from the vertex codec to convert tensors into resonance-domain containers. The codec captures golden-ratio unitary slices, prunes coefficients, and records quantisation settings while staying reversible via `decode_state_dict`. Round-trip tests exercise small and 1 MB tensors with ≤1e-6 error, so you know the packaging is lossless within documented tolerances.【F:algorithms/compression/vertex/rft_vertex_codec.py†L823-L910】【F:tests/validation/test_rft_vertex_codec_roundtrip.py†L1-L33】
3. **Attach a resonance digest.** Feed the encoded manifest into `GeometricWaveformHash.hash`. The pipeline maps bytes to unit-circle phases, applies the RFT, projects onto the deterministic manifold, and emits a 32-byte SHA-256 digest salted by the geometric embedding—an auditable fingerprint that preserves structural relationships while still diffusing bit flips.【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L77-L171】
4. **Seal the payload with resonance AEAD.** Protect the container using `EnhancedRFTCryptoV2.encrypt_aead`. Resonance-derived round keys, per-round phase locks, and keyed MixColumns diffusion yield a Feistel cipher whose authenticated-encryption mode withstands tampering—the validation suite confirms successful 64 KB and 1 MB round-trips, non-repeating ciphertexts, and rejection of single-bit modifications.【F:algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py†L31-L170】【F:tests/validation/test_enhanced_rft_crypto_streaming.py†L1-L73】
5. **Publish through the model router.** Drop the sealed artefact into the repository paths that `CompressedModelRouter` indexes. On boot it discovers quantum, assembly, and hybrid containers, tagging each with capabilities so the chatbox/front-end can surface the update with provenance intact.【F:quantonium_os_src/apps/system/compressed_model_router.py†L1-L196】

## How the pieces interlock

* **Boot orchestration** guarantees the same resonance kernel is shared by codecs, hashers, and crypto by validating their presence before the desktop comes up.【F:quantonium_boot.py†L146-L166】
* **Codec outputs** feed directly into the router and into hashing/encryption because the vertex containers expose deterministic manifests and checksums the other subsystems understand.【F:algorithms/compression/vertex/rft_vertex_codec.py†L875-L910】
* **Hash + crypto** reuse the resonance matrix: both `GeometricWaveformHash` and `EnhancedRFTCryptoV2` call into the φ-driven transform or its derivatives, aligning their avalanche characteristics with the codec’s spectral pruning logic.【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L47-L171】【F:algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py†L55-L170】
* **Runtime proof points** close the loop: the validation suite exercises the codec and AEAD flows on large payloads so you can cite executable evidence alongside the workflow narrative.【F:tests/validation/test_rft_vertex_codec_roundtrip.py†L7-L33】【F:tests/validation/test_enhanced_rft_crypto_streaming.py†L19-L73】

## What resonance computing enables beyond classical pipelines

| Challenge | Conventional approach | Resonance workflow | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Shared spectral basis** | DFT/DCT pipelines compress, hash, and encrypt independently, so each stage ignores the others’ structure. | RFT, hashing, and crypto all derive from the same φ-weighted unitary, keeping spatial + phase semantics consistent end-to-end. | Downstream verifiers can reason about tampering or loss using the same spectral coordinates that produced the payload.【F:algorithms/rft/core/canonical_true_rft.py†L18-L116】【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L35-L171】 |
| **Topology-preserving hashes** | Classical hashes maximise diffusion by destroying geometry. | GeometricWaveformHash projects onto a deterministic manifold before hashing, so similar inputs produce related embeddings even as the digest stays 32-byte and tamper-evident. | Enables provenance audits that compare resonance manifolds instead of only raw digests, useful for structured data pipelines.【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L53-L171】 |
| **Authenticated resonance encryption** | AES-style AEAD treats spectra as opaque bytes. | EnhancedRFTCryptoV2 modulates phases, amplitudes, and keyed diffusion matrices tied to the resonance kernel. | Payload protection inherits the same spectral guardrails, and validation shows it rejects single-bit tampering with large payloads.【F:algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py†L31-L170】【F:tests/validation/test_enhanced_rft_crypto_streaming.py†L19-L73】 |

In short, QuantoniumOS doesn’t just add another transform—it lets you build workflows where compression, hashing, encryption, and orchestration all consult the same resonance frame, unlocking end-to-end guarantees that classical pipelines have to approximate piecemeal.
