# Resonance Model Update Workflow – Security Analysis

## Scope
- **Workflow:** Boot → Vertex Codec → GeometricWaveformHash → EnhancedRFTCryptoV2 → CompressedModelRouter
- **Artefacts analysed:** `quantonium_boot.py`, `algorithms/compression/vertex/rft_vertex_codec.py`, `algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py`, `algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py`, `quantonium_os_src/apps/system/compressed_model_router.py`, and the documented workflow in `docs/technical/guides/RESONANCE_COMPUTING_PLAYBOOK.md`.
- **Adversary:** Network- or repo-level attacker capable of tampering with model containers, querying public endpoints, or observing ciphertext traffic.

## Summary of Findings
| Severity | Stage | Description | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **HIGH** | Provenance | Spectral fingerprints are reproducible by anyone because the hash pipeline uses public parameters seeded with fixed φ constants, so an attacker can forge provenance if they can recompute the hash over a poisoned model. | Introduce a secret or signer-bound salt (e.g., keyed HMAC or signature) around the hash output before publication. |
| **MEDIUM** | Information flow | Vertex codec manifests expose pruning thresholds, quantisation bits, and tensor counts in plaintext, leaking model architecture details to observers. | Encrypt manifests before transport or strip codec metadata unless the recipient is trusted. |
| **MEDIUM** | Composition | Shared RFT basis couples codec outputs with encryption; low diffusion in the cipher leaves resonance coefficients partially correlated, enabling multi-stage side channels. | Harden the cipher diffusion (as per the crypto analysis) and randomise codec basis slices per release. |
| **LOW** | Boot integrity | Boot validation checks for file presence but not authenticity, allowing replacement with malicious binaries if the repo is compromised. | Add signature verification (e.g., SHA-256 digests signed by release key) before accepting core components. |
| **INFO** | Router replay | Router trusts any sealed artefact on disk; absent a monotonic manifest or timestamp, replayed but stale artefacts still appear valid. | Track manifest publication epochs and reject outdated salts/versions. |

## 1. Information Flow Analysis

1. **Boot stage:** `validate_core_algorithms` confirms only that expected files exist, not that they match trusted digests.【F:quantonium_boot.py†L146-L166】 Attackers replacing `canonical_true_rft.py` or the crypto module with backdoored versions evade detection.
2. **Vertex codec:** Encoded manifests embed codec parameters (`prune_threshold`, `quant_bits_*`, tensor map) in clear JSON, revealing model sparsity, quantisation, and tensor names to any observer.【F:algorithms/compression/vertex/rft_vertex_codec.py†L823-L874】 Confidentiality is limited to payload encryption; metadata leaks remain.
3. **Hashing:** `GeometricWaveformHash` uses deterministic manifold matrices seeded from a public φ-derived seed (`np.random.seed(seed_value)`), so the spectral signature is reproducible without a key.【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L53-L74】 The final digest includes SHA-256 over embedding and original data, but offers no secrecy.
4. **Encryption:** AEAD hides payload bytes and MACs associated data, yet diffusion shortfalls leave ciphertexts partially correlated with plaintext resonances under multi-ciphertext analysis, especially when the same codec basis is reused.【F:algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py†L348-L414】【F:algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py†L604-L674】
5. **Router:** The router enumerates models by scanning directories and recording metadata including compression ratios and sizes; it does not authenticate manifests beyond trusting filesystem contents.【F:quantonium_os_src/apps/system/compressed_model_router.py†L120-L195】

## 2. Provenance Security
- **Fingerprint forging:** Because the hash pipeline is public and deterministic, an attacker who poisons a model can recompute the geometric hash and publish the forged digest, making provenance indistinguishable from an honest signer.【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L150-L171】【F:docs/technical/guides/RESONANCE_COMPUTING_PLAYBOOK.md†L15-L30】 Integrating a secret signing key or at least a keyed HMAC would bind provenance to the legitimate issuer.
- **Collision risk in φ-space:** The manifold projection is fixed and low dimensional; adversaries can search for different payloads mapping to similar manifold coordinates because quantised embeddings have limited resolution (`np.round(manifold_point * 1000)`).【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L115-L127】 While final SHA-256 resists full collisions, near-collisions in manifold space enable crafting inputs with similar spectral fingerprints that may pass heuristic checks.
- **Chain integrity:** Once encrypted, the AEAD tag protects the container, but there is no end-to-end signature tying the codec output, hash, and ciphertext to a release identity. The workflow guide assumes trust in local execution without distribution-time attestation.【F:docs/technical/guides/RESONANCE_COMPUTING_PLAYBOOK.md†L13-L31】

## 3. Composition Security
The codec, hash, and cipher all operate on the same φ-weighted basis. This alignment eases debugging but introduces shared-mode failure: if an attacker learns enough about the codec’s spectral basis (e.g., via leaked tensors), they can craft inputs whose resonance coefficients survive low diffusion in the cipher, leading to ciphertext statistical biases. Strengthening the cipher (see crypto security analysis) and randomising codec parameters per release (e.g., include a salt in `CanonicalTrueRFT`) would break this coupling.【F:algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py†L348-L414】【F:algorithms/compression/vertex/rft_vertex_codec.py†L823-L874】 Independent auditing of each subsystem remains necessary because the workflow composition lacks formal proofs.

## 4. Threat Scenarios

### Scenario A – Model Poisoning
**Goal:** Inject malicious model while producing believable provenance.

**Attack tree:**
1. Gain write access to repository or distribution channel.
2. Replace vertex codec output with poisoned tensors.
3. Recompute geometric hash locally (trivial, deterministic).
4. Re-encrypt with attacker-controlled key and publish artefact.
5. Router discovers artefact and surfaces it (no signature verification).

**Evaluation:** Hash alone cannot distinguish attacker output. Integrity depends solely on distribution controls. Recommendation: Sign the hash manifest or embed a digital signature in the AEAD associated data referencing a public key.

### Scenario B – Spectral Side Channel
**Goal:** Infer model structure from encrypted payloads.

**Attack tree:**
1. Observe multiple ciphertexts for related models (e.g., sequential checkpoints).
2. Exploit message-avalanche bias (0.438) to correlate ciphertext bit flips with expected codec coefficient changes.【F:algorithms/rft/core/enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py†L604-L674】
3. Use knowledge of codec metadata (quantisation bits, tensor names) leaked in clear to narrow hypotheses.【F:algorithms/compression/vertex/rft_vertex_codec.py†L823-L874】
4. Recover coarse-grained model architecture or detect specific layer alterations.

**Evaluation:** Without diffusion fixes, the attack gives partial information (e.g., positions of large coefficient updates). Encrypting metadata and hardening diffusion reduces leakage.

### Scenario C – Resonance Oracle Attack
**Goal:** Learn the RFT matrix Ψ by querying the system.

**Attack tree:**
1. Feed crafted payloads through public interfaces that expose hashed digests or encrypted artefacts.
2. Observe deterministic manifold outputs or ciphertext biases.
3. Because manifold seed and hash process are public, attacker can solve for RFT columns from outputs of `_bytes_to_signal` combined with known phases.【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L77-L171】
4. Once Ψ is known, tailor poisoning payloads that survive codec pruning or degrade avalanche further.

**Evaluation:** The attack is feasible due to deterministic seeding and lack of secret salts. Mitigation: randomise RFT basis per deployment and keep seeds confidential.

## 5. Hardening Recommendations
1. **Introduce signing:** Wrap the hash digest in a digital signature or keyed MAC stored with the router manifest so provenance checks require access to issuer secrets.【F:docs/technical/guides/RESONANCE_COMPUTING_PLAYBOOK.md†L15-L31】
2. **Encrypt metadata:** Include codec metadata inside the AEAD-protected payload or encrypt manifests separately to prevent architecture leakage.【F:algorithms/compression/vertex/rft_vertex_codec.py†L823-L874】
3. **Randomise resonance seeds:** Use deployment-specific salts for RFT basis generation in both codec and hash to break reproducibility for attackers without access to secrets.【F:algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py†L53-L74】
4. **Verify boot integrity:** Extend `validate_core_algorithms` to check signed digests before starting services.【F:quantonium_boot.py†L146-L166】
5. **Monitor router inputs:** Require manifests to include version counters or timestamps and reject artefacts whose salts or signatures replay earlier releases.【F:quantonium_os_src/apps/system/compressed_model_router.py†L120-L195】

Implementing these measures closes the provenance gap, mitigates spectral leakage, and ensures that resonance-based components reinforce rather than weaken one another.
