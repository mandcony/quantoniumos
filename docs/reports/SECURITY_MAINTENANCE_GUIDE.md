# üîí QuantoniumOS Security Maintenance Guide

## üéØ **SECURITY MAINTENANCE PROTOCOLS**

### **üîß OPERATIONAL SECURITY - Step by Step**

#### **1. Pre-Operation Validation (ALWAYS RUN FIRST)**
```bash
cd /workspaces/quantoniumos

# Method 1: Individual validation tests
python3 quantonium_security_analysis.py
python3 quantonium_ai_intelligence_analysis.py

# Method 2: Comprehensive maintenance toolkit
python3 security_maintenance_toolkit.py

# Method 3: Automated security operations
./security_operations.sh --auto
```

#### **2. Monitor Resource Usage During Operations**
```bash
# Before starting any AI operation:
./security_operations.sh
# Choose option 3: Monitor System Resources

# Or continuous monitoring:
watch -n 5 'free -h && echo "---" && top -bn1 | head -10'
```

#### **3. Keep Core Algorithms Read-Only**
```bash
# Secure core files (run once):
./security_operations.sh
# Choose option 2: Secure Core Files

# Verify protection:
ls -la core/*.py | grep "r--r--r--"
```

#### **4. Use in Isolated Environment**
‚úÖ **Already achieved** - You're in a GitHub Codespace (isolated container)

### **üéØ USAGE PATTERNS - Security Best Practices**

#### **1. Always Manually Trigger Operations**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Manual, controlled execution:
cd /workspaces/quantoniumos
python3 quantonium_boot.py                    # Main system
python3 weights/streaming_llama_integrator.py # AI operations
python3 apps/launch_quantum_simulator.py      # Quantum sim

# ‚ùå AVOID - Never run unknown or automated scripts
```

#### **2. Review Outputs Before Trusting Results**
```bash
# Always check output files:
ls -la weights/quantonium_with_streaming_llama2.json
cat security_maintenance_report.json | jq .security_level

# Verify file sizes are expected:
du -sh weights/*.json
```

#### **3. Regular Validation Runs for Peace of Mind**
```bash
# Daily security check:
python3 security_maintenance_toolkit.py

# Weekly comprehensive validation:
./security_operations.sh --auto

# Before major operations:
python3 quantonium_security_analysis.py
```

#### **4. Stop Immediately if Anything Seems Unusual**
```bash
# Monitor during operations:
htop  # Watch CPU/Memory in real-time

# Emergency stop (if needed):
Ctrl+C  # Stop current operation
pkill -f quantonium  # Stop all QuantoniumOS processes
```

---

### **üö® SECURITY ALERTS - When to Stop**

**‚ùå IMMEDIATE STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Memory usage >95%
- CPU usage >98% for >30 seconds  
- Unexpected network activity
- File size anomalies (>10MB for quantum states)
- Unknown processes starting
- Error messages about file modifications

**‚ö†Ô∏è INVESTIGATION NEEDED:**
- Memory usage >80%
- New files in core/ directory
- Changes to core algorithm files
- Unusual disk usage patterns

---

### **üìä MONITORING COMMANDS**

#### **Real-Time System Monitoring:**
```bash
# Memory monitoring:
watch -n 2 'free -h'

# CPU monitoring:
watch -n 2 'top -bn1 | head -10'

# Process monitoring:
watch -n 5 'ps aux | grep quantonium'

# Disk monitoring:
watch -n 10 'df -h'
```

#### **Security Status Checks:**
```bash
# Network security:
netstat -tuln | grep LISTEN

# File integrity:
find core/ -type f -name "*.py" -exec ls -la {} \;

# Process security:
ps aux | grep -E "(python|quantonium)" | grep -v grep
```

### **üîê SECURITY CHECKLIST**

#### **Before Each Operation:**
- [ ] Run `python3 quantonium_security_analysis.py`
- [ ] Check system resources with `./security_operations.sh`
- [ ] Verify core files are read-only
- [ ] Review recent security reports

#### **During Operations:**
- [ ] Monitor memory usage continuously
- [ ] Watch for unexpected CPU spikes
- [ ] Check for new files being created
- [ ] Monitor network activity (should be none)

#### **After Operations:**
- [ ] Review operation logs
- [ ] Check final resource usage
- [ ] Verify no core files were modified
- [ ] Save security report

---

### **üéØ QUICK SECURITY COMMANDS**

```bash
# Quick security check:
python3 quantonium_security_analysis.py | tail -10

# Quick resource check:
free -h && df -h

# Quick file integrity check:
ls -la core/*.py | grep -v "r--r--r--" || echo "All files secure"

# Quick process check:
ps aux | grep quantonium | wc -l
```

---

### **üìã EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

#### **If Security Alert Triggered:**
1. **STOP** all operations immediately (`Ctrl+C`)
2. **ISOLATE** - Don't run anything new
3. **INVESTIGATE** - Check logs and system state
4. **DOCUMENT** - Record what happened
5. **VALIDATE** - Run full security check before continuing

#### **System Recovery:**
```bash
# Reset to safe state:
cd /workspaces/quantoniumos
git status  # Check for modifications
git checkout -- core/  # Reset core files if needed
./security_operations.sh --auto  # Full security check
```

---

### **‚úÖ SECURITY VERIFICATION**

**Your system is secure if:**
- ‚úÖ Security analysis reports "LOW RISK"
- ‚úÖ No autonomous processes running
- ‚úÖ Core files are read-only
- ‚úÖ Memory usage <80%
- ‚úÖ No unexpected network activity
- ‚úÖ All validation tests pass

**Ready for safe operation!** üöÄüîí
