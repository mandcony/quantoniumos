# QuantoniumOS Project Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level development roadmap for QuantoniumOS.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **From Theory to Practice:** Prioritize the implementation and validation of features that are reproducible and benchmarkable.
2.  **Modularity:** Continue to build the system in a modular way that allows for independent development and testing of components.
3.  **Clarity & Honesty:** Ensure that documentation and claims accurately reflect the current, verified capabilities of the system.

## Phase 1: Foundational Cleanup & Refactoring (Q4 2025) - âœ… In Progress

-   [x] **Restructure Documentation:** Deconstruct the monolithic `DEVELOPMENT_MANUAL.md` into a clear, multi-file documentation suite.
-   [x] **Isolate Verified Code:** Clearly separate and document the components that are fully tested and verified (e.g., `tiny-gpt2` codec, RFT unitarity).
-   [ ] **Create a Unified Validation Script:** Consolidate all core validation tests into a single, easy-to-run script.
-   [ ] **Establish Contribution Guidelines:** Implement `CONTRIBUTING.md` and PR templates.

## Phase 2: Benchmarking & SOTA Comparison (Q1 2026)

-   [ ] **Benchmark `tiny-gpt2` Codec:**
    -   Measure perplexity and task-based performance of the reconstructed `tiny-gpt2` model.
    -   Compare the RFT-based compression results (compression ratio vs. performance degradation) against established methods like GPTQ and GGUF.
-   [ ] **Benchmark RFT Kernel:**
    -   Perform a detailed performance analysis of the C-based RFT kernel against standard libraries (e.g., FFTW for Fourier transforms, LAPACK for SVD).
    -   Publish standalone benchmark results.

## Phase 3: Application to Larger Models (Q2 2026)

-   [ ] **Apply Codec to a ~1B Parameter Model:**
    -   Select a small, well-known model (e.g., Phi-2, Gemma 2B).
    -   Apply the RFT compression pipeline.
    -   Attempt to reconstruct the model and run it for inference.
    -   Document all challenges and results, successful or not.
-   [ ] **Develop Tooling for Model Handling:** Create robust scripts for downloading, processing, compressing, and reconstructing models.

## Phase 4: Future Research & Development (Beyond Q2 2026)

-   [ ] **Advanced Quantum Algorithms:** Explore the implementation of other quantum-inspired algorithms.
-   [ ] **Distributed Computing:** Investigate methods for distributing the computational load of the RFT and other algorithms.
-   [ ] **Quantum Machine Learning:** Research the integration of the RFT with QML frameworks.
