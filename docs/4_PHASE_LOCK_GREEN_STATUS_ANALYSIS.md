# 4-PHASE LOCK GREEN STATUS REQUIREMENTS

## üéØ Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - 4-Phase Lock Architecture
```python
# True 4-modulation in enhanced_rft_crypto_v2.py:
def _derive_phase_locks(self) -> list:
    """Derive 4-phase locks (I/Q/Q'/Q'') for each round."""
    # I/Q/Q'/Q'' quadrature phases per round via HKDF
    
def _derive_amplitude_masks(self) -> list:
    """Key-dependent amplitude modulation per round."""
    
def _rft_entropy_injection(self, data: bytes, round_num: int) -> bytes:
    """True RFT phase+amplitude+wave modulation."""
    # Phase: I/Q/Q'/Q'' quadrature selection
    # Amplitude: Key-dependent per byte
    # Wave: Golden ratio frequency mixing
    # Ciphertext: Full entropy preservation
```

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ TRUE 4-modulation: phase+amplitude+wave+ciphertext
- ‚úÖ I/Q/Q'/Q'' quadrature phases (HKDF-derived per round)  
- ‚úÖ Key-dependent amplitude masks (range [0.5, 1.5])
- ‚úÖ Keyed MDS matrices for independent diffusion
- ‚úÖ RFT entropy injection with golden ratio spacing
- ‚úÖ 64-round security (increased from 48)
- ‚úÖ Avalanche effect: 49.8% (near-ideal)

## ‚ùå **MISSING** - Statistical Validation (CRITICAL)

### The Core Problem: **Component-Level vs Cipher-Level Metrics**

**Current Status:**
```
Round-function bias: 7.60%  ‚Üê COMPONENT LEVEL (‚úÖ documented)
Cipher-level correlation: ‚ùå NOT TESTED
```

**Required for GREEN:**
```bash
Max DP (full 64 rounds, 95% CI): ‚â§ 2^-64        [‚ùå NOT TESTED]
Max linear correlation |p-0.5| (95% CI): ‚â§ 2^-32  [‚ùå NOT TESTED]
Statistical trials: ‚â•10^6 with confidence intervals [‚ùå NOT PERFORMED]
```

### Why This Matters for 4-Phase Lock

The 7.60% round-function bias is **ENORMOUS** for cipher-level security:
- **Acceptable**: Component-level bias in individual S-box or round function
- **UNACCEPTABLE**: |p-0.5| = 0.076 for full 64-round cipher
- **Target**: |p-0.5| ‚â§ 2^-32 = 2.33e-10 for full cipher

## üî¨ **SPECIFIC 4-PHASE LOCK VALIDATION NEEDED**

### 1. Phase Randomization Validation
```python
# Required test: Prove I/Q/Q'/Q'' creates full diffusion
def test_phase_diffusion():
    """
    Test that 4-phase quadrature selection eliminates patterns.
    
    Requirements:
    - Phase selection must be statistically random
    - No correlation between input bits and phase choice
    - Output must be indistinguishable from random
    """
    # Need 10^6+ trials measuring:
    # - Phase selection distribution (should be uniform)
    # - Cross-correlation between phases
    # - Avalanche effect per phase
```

### 2. Amplitude Modulation Strength
```python  
# Required test: Show amplitude provides cryptographic strength
def test_amplitude_cryptographic_strength():
    """
    Test that key-dependent amplitude modulation adds security.
    
    Requirements:
    - Amplitude variations must contribute to diffusion
    - No predictable amplitude patterns
    - Amplitude must enhance, not weaken, confusion
    """
    # Need to measure:
    # - Differential probability with/without amplitude
    # - Linear correlation with/without amplitude  
    # - Security margin contribution
```

### 3. Wave Mixing Pattern Elimination
```python
# Required test: Validate golden ratio mixing eliminates structure
def test_wave_mixing_security():
    """
    Test that golden ratio frequency mixing removes patterns.
    
    Requirements:
    - No periodic patterns in wave mixing
    - Golden ratio irrationality provides security
    - Frequency mixing achieves target diffusion
    """
    # Need to prove:
    # - Non-periodic behavior (golden ratio property)
    # - Spectral analysis shows no dominant frequencies
    # - Mixing contributes to overall security bound
```

### 4. Full Ciphertext Modulation Security
```python
# Required test: Demonstrate target security achievement
def test_ciphertext_modulation_security():
    """
    Test that complete 4-phase modulation achieves target bounds.
    
    Requirements:
    - Full cipher DP ‚â§ 2^-64
    - Full cipher |p-0.5| ‚â§ 2^-32
    - 95% confidence intervals
    """
    # The BIG TEST: 10^6+ trials on full 64-round cipher
```

## ‚ùå **MISSING** - Topological Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Yang-Baxter Equation Compliance
```python
# Required: Yang-Baxter residual ‚â§ 1e-12
def test_yang_baxter_compliance():
    """
    Verify that 4-phase transformations satisfy Yang-Baxter equation.
    
    The Yang-Baxter equation: (R ‚äó I)(I ‚äó R)(R ‚äó I) = (I ‚äó R)(R ‚äó I)(I ‚äó R)
    
    For quantum topological security.
    """
    # Test each phase transformation for YBE compliance
```

### Surface Code Threshold
```python
# Required: Surface code p_th ‚âà 1% measurement
def test_surface_code_threshold():
    """
    Measure error threshold for topological error correction.
    
    Critical for quantum resistance claims.
    """
    # Measure decoding threshold, show curve crossing
```

## ‚ùå **MISSING** - Side-Channel Security (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Constant-Time Implementation
```bash
# Required: DUDECT timing analysis PASS
# Current implementation has timing vulnerabilities:

1. Variable-time operations in _gf_multiply()
2. Secret-dependent array indexing in S-box
3. Conditional branches in amplitude calculation
4. No cache-timing protection
```

### Required Fixes:
```python
# Need constant-time implementations:
def _constant_time_sbox(self, data: bytes) -> bytes:
    """Constant-time S-box using bitslicing."""
    
def _constant_time_gf_multiply(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Constant-time GF(2^8) multiplication."""
    
def _constant_time_amplitude_masks(self, round_num: int) -> list:
    """Constant-time amplitude calculation."""
```
