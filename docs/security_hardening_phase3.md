# Quantonium OS Security Hardening - Phase 3: Audit & Monitoring

## Overview

Phase 3 of the Quantonium OS security hardening initiative focuses on implementing comprehensive audit and monitoring capabilities. This phase introduces structured JSON logging, request timing metrics, and enhanced observability through system health and performance metrics endpoints.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Structured JSON Logging

- **Custom JSON Formatter**:
  - Outputs standardized log fields in JSON format
  - Captures timestamp, route, status code, and elapsed time
  - Includes SHA-256 hashing of request bodies to prevent sensitive data exposure
  - Records API key prefix (first 8 chars) for audit correlation
  - Logs remote IP addresses for security analysis

- **Timed Rotating File Handler**:
  - Automatically rotates logs daily
  - Retains logs for 14 days
  - Organizes logs in a dedicated `logs/` directory
  - Provides a clean mechanism for log archival and analysis

### 2. Request Timing Middleware

- **Performance Tracking**:
  - Records precise request start time using high-resolution timer
  - Calculates request duration in milliseconds
  - Adds `X-Request-Time` header to all responses
  - Logs timing information for performance trend analysis
  - Enables detection of performance anomalies or slowdowns

### 3. Enhanced Health & Metrics

- **Expanded Health Check Endpoint**:
  - Includes server uptime metrics
  - Provides version information
  - Reports timestamp of health check
  - Returns hostname information
  - Remains exempt from rate limiting

- **System Metrics Endpoint**:
  - Provides memory usage statistics (RSS)
  - Reports CPU utilization percentage
  - Tracks number of open files
  - Counts active threads
  - Displays rate limiting statistics

## Security Benefits

These monitoring and audit enhancements deliver the following security benefits:

1. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Full visibility into all API requests with standardized logging.

2. **Performance Monitoring**: Early detection of potential DoS attacks or system resource exhaustion.

3. **Privacy Protection**: Hashing of request bodies prevents accidental logging of sensitive information.

4. **Security Analytics**: Structured logs enable automated analysis tools to detect attack patterns.

5. **Incident Response**: Detailed records assist with post-incident analysis and forensics.

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these key principles:

- **Non-blocking Design**: Logging operations are optimized to minimize impact on request processing.
- **Privacy by Design**: No sensitive data is logged in plaintext.
- **Standardized Format**: Consistent JSON structure enables easy parsing and analysis.
- **High-Performance**: Middleware uses high-resolution timers for accurate measurements.
- **Correlation Support**: Request identifiers and timestamps allow cross-system correlation.

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:

- Verification of log file creation and format
- Validation of JSON schema for log entries
- Testing of request body hashing functionality
- Verification of timing header in responses
- Multiple request logging validation

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, the Quantonium OS security hardening initiative will proceed to Phase 4: Dependency & Supply-Chain Safety, which will focus on:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Third-party library security analysis
- Supply chain integrity verification
- Package signature validation
