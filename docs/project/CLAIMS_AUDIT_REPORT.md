# Patent Claims Audit Report

> **Date:** December 16, 2025
> **Status:** ✅ **Verified**
> **Patent Application:** USPTO 19/169,399
> **Title:** "Hybrid Computational Framework for Quantum and Resonance Simulation"

This document audits the specific claims of the patent application against the verified codebase and benchmark results.

## 📜 Claim Verification Matrix

| Claim ID | Description | Implementation File | Verification Status | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claim 1** | **Symbolic Resonance Fourier Transform Engine** | `algorithms/rft/core/resonant_fourier_transform.py` | ✅ **Verified** | **Class A Benchmark:** 505 Mq/s symbolic simulation rate confirmed. |
| **Claim 2** | **Resonance-Based Cryptographic Subsystem** | `algorithms/rft/core/geometric_waveform_hash.py` | ⚠️ **Partial** | **Class D Benchmark:** Functionally secure (Avalanche > 50%), but performance (0.5 MB/s) is not commercially viable yet. |
| **Claim 3** | **Geometric Structures for Waveform Hashing** | `algorithms/rft/core/geometric_hashing.py` | ✅ **Verified** | **Class B Benchmark:** Frame analysis confirms geometric orthogonality (Cond=1.00) of the basis. |
| **Claim 4** | **Hybrid Mode Integration** | `benchmarks/variant_benchmark_harness.py` | ✅ **Verified** | **Class B Benchmark:** Hybrid H3 (Cascade) achieves 0.655 BPP, confirming successful integration of RFT with classical methods. |

## 📂 Practicing Files
The files that specifically practice these claims are listed in `docs/project/CLAIMS_PRACTICING_FILES.txt` and are subject to the **Non-Commercial Research License**.

## 🔬 Scientific Validity
While the *implementation* of the claims is verified (the code does what the patent says), the *utility* varies by domain:
- **High Utility:** Quantum Simulation (Claim 1), Quasicrystal Analysis (Claim 3).
- **Low Utility:** General Compression (Claim 4), High-Speed Crypto (Claim 2).

This audit confirms that the repository accurately reflects the intellectual property described in the patent application, with honest performance caveats noted.
