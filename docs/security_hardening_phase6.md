# Quantonium OS Security Hardening - Phase 6: Runtime Isolation & Sandbox Hardening

## Overview

Phase 6 implements comprehensive runtime isolation and container sandboxing for the Quantonium OS API, focusing on reducing the attack surface through seccomp profiles, capability restrictions, read-only filesystems, and isolated namespaces.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Seccomp Profile

- **Default Deny**: Implements a whitelist-based seccomp profile that denies all syscalls by default
- **Minimal Syscalls**: Only allows specifically required syscalls for the application to function
- **Blocked Dangerous Calls**: Explicitly blocks ptrace, mount, namespace manipulation, and other high-risk syscalls
- **Multiple Architecture Support**: Profile works across x86_64, x86, x32, and ARM64 architectures

### 2. Capability Management

- **Drop All Capabilities**: Removes all Linux capabilities from the container
- **Zero Special Privileges**: Even common capabilities like NET_BIND_SERVICE are not included
- **Non-root Execution**: Container runs as unprivileged user `quant` (UID 1001)

### 3. Filesystem Restrictions

- **Read-only Root**: Container root filesystem is mounted read-only
- **Tmpfs Volumes**: Only specific temporary directories are writable, using tmpfs volumes
- **Segregated Logging**: Log files written to isolated tmpfs volume

### 4. Namespace Isolation

- **PID Namespace**: Container runs in isolated PID namespace
- **Non-root User Namespace**: User namespace restricts access to host resources
- **Process Isolation**: Container processes cannot see or interact with host processes

### 5. Security Scanning & Testing

- **Dockle Integration**: Automated scanning for container security best practices
- **Trivy Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning in CI pipeline
- **Penetration Testing**: Comprehensive test script to verify security controls
- **CI/CD Integration**: Security scans integrated into GitHub Actions workflow

## Implementation Details

### Seccomp Profile

The `seccomp.json` file implements a syscall whitelist using Linux's seccomp-bpf filter. The profile:

1. Sets default action to `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` (deny and return error)
2. Explicitly allows only required syscalls like `read`, `write`, `open`, etc.
3. Is referenced in docker-compose.yml via `security_opt: seccomp:./seccomp.json`
4. Blocks high-risk syscalls regardless of user privileges

### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
services:
  quantonium:
    # ... other settings ...
    read_only: true
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
      - seccomp:./seccomp.json
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add: []
    pid: "container"
    user: "quant:1001"
    volumes:
      - tmpfs_logs:/app/logs:rw
      - tmpfs_tmp:/tmp:rw
```

### Testing & Validation

The `scripts/pentest.sh` script attempts various container escape techniques:

1. Shell escape attempts
2. Package installation attempts
3. Filesystem modification attempts
4. Capability checks
5. System call validation tests

All tests should fail, confirming that the security measures are properly implemented.

### Security Scanning

Two automated scanning tools are integrated:

1. **Dockle**: Checks container configuration against security best practices
2. **Trivy**: Scans for known vulnerabilities in the container image

The CI pipeline fails if any HIGH or CRITICAL issues are found.

## Usage Instructions

### Running with Security Hardening

To run the container with all security features enabled:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Testing Security Features

Validate that security features are correctly implemented:

```bash
./scripts/pentest.sh
```

### Updating Seccomp Profile

If application requirements change:

1. Edit `seccomp.json` to add/remove required syscalls
2. Restart the container with `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
3. Validate changes with `./scripts/pentest.sh`

## Technical Considerations

- The seccomp profile is tailored to the specific needs of Quantonium OS
- Adding unnecessary syscalls increases the attack surface
- Removing required syscalls will cause the application to fail
- PID namespace isolation can affect certain debugging tools
- Read-only filesystem requires careful consideration of writable paths

## Security Response Procedures

In case of a detected sandbox escape:

1. Immediately shut down the affected container
2. Analyze logs for evidence of the vulnerability
3. Update seccomp profile and container configuration
4. Deploy updated container with fixed security controls
5. Document the incident and update penetration tests

## Next Steps

Phase 7 will focus on Final Documentation & Release Candidate sign-off, including:

1. Comprehensive security documentation
2. Secure deployment guidelines
3. CI/CD pipeline finalization
4. Security release process
5. Release candidate validation
