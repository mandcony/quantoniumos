# Quantonium OS Security Hardening - Priority Matrix

This document outlines the planned security hardening phases for Quantonium OS, prioritized by impact and implementation complexity.

## Priority Levels

- **Critical (C)**: Must be implemented immediately
- **High (H)**: Required for secure production use
- **Medium (M)**: Important for overall security posture
- **Low (L)**: Enhances security but not critical

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Cryptographic Integrity | C | **COMPLETE** | Enhanced encryption, secure random generation, proper signature verification |
| 2 | API Attack-Surface Hardening | C | **COMPLETE** | Security headers, HSTS, CSP, rate limiting, CORS protection |
| 3 | Audit & Monitoring | H | PENDING | Comprehensive logging, audit trails, and security event monitoring |
| 4 | Container Registry Security | H | PENDING | Secure container storage, registry access controls, and container lifecycle management |
| 5 | Authentication Framework | H | PENDING | User authentication, session management, and credential handling |
| 6 | Access Control | M | PENDING | Role-based access control, permission management, and privilege separation |
| 7 | Runtime Protection | M | PENDING | Memory safety, execution environment hardening, and runtime integrity |
