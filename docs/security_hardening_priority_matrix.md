# Quantonium OS Security Hardening - Priority Matrix

This document outlines the planned security hardening phases for Quantonium OS, prioritized by impact and implementation complexity.

## Priority Levels

- **Critical (C)**: Must be implemented immediately
- **High (H)**: Required for secure production use
- **Medium (M)**: Important for overall security posture
- **Low (L)**: Enhances security but not critical

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Cryptographic Integrity | C | **COMPLETE** | Enhanced encryption, secure random generation, proper signature verification |
| 2 | API Attack-Surface Hardening | C | **COMPLETE** | Security headers, HSTS, CSP, rate limiting, CORS protection |
| 3 | Audit & Monitoring | H | **COMPLETE** | Comprehensive logging, audit trails, and security event monitoring |
| 4 | Container & Supply-Chain Security | H | **COMPLETE** | Dependency pinning, container hardening, vulnerability scanning, image signing |
| 5 | Authentication Framework | H | PENDING | User authentication, session management, and credential handling |
| 6 | Access Control | M | PENDING | Role-based access control, permission management, and privilege separation |
| 7 | Runtime Protection | M | PENDING | Memory safety, execution environment hardening, and runtime integrity |

## Implementation Schedule

### Phase 1: Cryptographic Integrity (COMPLETE)
- Enhanced encryption algorithms
- Secure random number generation
- Signature verification with timing attack protection
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 2: API Attack-Surface Hardening (COMPLETE)
- Implemented security headers (X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc.)
- Added Content Security Policy with strict defaults
- Integrated rate limiting (60 requests per minute per IP)
- Implemented CORS protection with environment-based configuration
- Added health check endpoint with proper security exemptions

### Phase 3: Audit & Monitoring (COMPLETE)
- Implemented structured JSON logging for all API requests
- Created timed log rotation with 14-day retention
- Added X-Request-Time header for performance tracking
- Enhanced health check endpoints with system monitoring
- Set up metrics endpoint with memory and CPU monitoring
- Fixed trailing slash issues to prevent POST data loss
- Secured log rotation with proper permissions

### Phase 4: Container & Supply-Chain Security (COMPLETE)
- Pinned all dependencies to exact versions
- Implemented multi-stage Docker build with non-root user
- Added read-only filesystem with explicit write paths
- Integrated vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Set up container signing with Cosign
- Created secure CI/CD pipeline
- Added validation scripts and security documentation

### Phase 5: Authentication Framework (NEXT)
- Develop user authentication system
- Implement secure session management
- Add credential handling and storage
- Support multi-factor authentication

### Phase 6: Access Control
- Implement role-based access control
- Add permission management
- Create privilege separation
- Develop secure object access

### Phase 7: Runtime Protection
- Enhance memory safety
- Harden execution environment
- Add runtime integrity verification
- Implement secure boot sequence
