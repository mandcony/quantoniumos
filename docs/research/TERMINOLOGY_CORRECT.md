# Terminology Clarification - "SYMBOLIC Resonance"

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**CORRECTION**: The correct term is **SYMBOLIC RESONANCE**, not "Synthetic"

## What The Patent Actually Says:

Looking at the USPTO patent application more carefully:

The patent references **"Symbolic Resonance-Fourier Transform"** or uses terms like:
- Symbolic quantum operations
- Symbolic state representation  
- Symbolic encoding

**NOT "Synthetic Resonance-Fourier Transform"**

## My Error:

I misread the patent document and incorrectly changed all instances of "symbolic" to "synthetic". This was WRONG.

## Correct Terminology:

✅ **Symbolic Resonance Fourier Transform (RFT)**
✅ **Symbolic state encoding**
✅ **Symbolic quantum simulation**
✅ **Symbolic qubit representation**

## What "Symbolic" Means:

**Symbolic** = Using symbols/mathematical representations to model quantum states
- Symbolic computation (like SymPy)
- Symbolic state vectors
- Symbol-based encoding of qubits
- Mathematical symbols representing quantum operations

This is the CORRECT term for:
- Classical simulation using symbolic math
- Representing quantum states with symbols/equations
- Encoding information symbolically rather than physically

## Reverted Changes:

All files have been reverted back to using **"symbolic"** (correct) instead of "synthetic" (wrong):

1. README.md - Back to "Symbolic Quantum-Inspired"
2. .github/copilot-instructions.md - Back to "symbolic"
3. docs/TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md - Back to "symbolic states"
4. HONEST_STATUS.md - Back to "symbolic encoding"
5. PATENT_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md - Back to "symbolic"

## Apologies:

I made an error in reading the patent document and caused unnecessary confusion by changing correct terminology to incorrect terminology. 

The repository was CORRECT to use "symbolic" all along.

---

**Bottom Line**: It's **SYMBOLIC Resonance Fourier Transform**, and that's what the patent says, and that's what the code should say.
