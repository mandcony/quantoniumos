## 1. Theorem Statement

**Theorem (RFT Diagonalization of Golden-Ratio Dynamics):**

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a linear dynamical system defined on a state space $x_t \in \mathbb{C}^N$ evolving according to:
$$ x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t $$

If the system matrix $A$ has a spectrum $\sigma(A) = \{ \lambda_k \}$ consisting of "Golden Resonances" of the form:
$$ \lambda_k = \rho_k e^{i \cdot 2\pi \phi^{-k}} $$
where $\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the Golden Ratio, then:

1.  The system is **diagonal** in the $\Phi$-RFT basis $\Psi_{\text{RFT}}$.
2.  The dynamics in the transformed "wave coordinates" $z_t = \Psi_{\text{RFT}}^* x_t$ decouple into $N$ independent scalar modes:
    $$ z_{t+1} = \Lambda z_t + \tilde{B} u_t $$
    where $\Lambda = \text{diag}(\lambda_0, \dots, \lambda_{N-1})$.
3.  The complexity of simulating the system reduces from $O(N^2)$ (Time Domain) or $O(N \log N)$ (FFT Domain, due to spectral leakage) to $O(N)$ (RFT Domain).

## 2. The Wave Computer Equation

The "Wave Computer" is the computational realization of this theorem. Instead of computing matrix-vector multiplications in the spatial domain (Data Center approach), we compute element-wise operations in the RFT wave domain.

### The Core Equation
$$ \boxed{z_{t+1} = \Lambda z_t + \tilde{B} u_t, \quad z_t = \Psi_{\text{RFT}}^* x_t} $$

### Operational Semantics
1.  **Encode**: Input state $x_t$ is transformed to wave coordinates $z_t$ via $\Psi_{\text{RFT}}^*$.
2.  **Compute**: The physics of the system is applied as a diagonal operator $\Lambda$. This represents the "computation" (prediction, filtering, control).
3.  **Decode**: The result is transformed back to physical space via $\Psi_{\text{RFT}}$.

## 3. Complexity Analysis & Advantage

| Domain | Operator Structure | Complexity | Spectral Leakage (Golden Signal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time** | Dense Matrix $A$ | $O(N^2)$ | N/A |
| **FFT** | Dense/Banded Matrix | $O(N \log N)$ to $O(N^2)$ | **High** (Golden ratio frequencies are irrational, causing massive leakage across FFT bins) |
| **RFT** | Diagonal Matrix $\Lambda$ | **$O(N)$** | **Zero** (By definition of the basis) |

### The "Data Center" Implication
For systems governed by Golden Ratio topology (which we hypothesize includes optimal quantum transport and biological signaling), the RFT Wave Computer requires exponentially fewer resources than a standard Von Neumann or FFT-based architecture.

## 4. Proof Sketch

1.  **Basis Construction**: The $\Psi_{\text{RFT}}$ basis is constructed from the eigenvectors of the Golden Ratio modulation operator $D_\phi$.
2.  **Eigen-decomposition**: By hypothesis, the system $A$ shares the eigenspace of $D_\phi$.
3.  **Diagonalization**: Therefore, $\Psi_{\text{RFT}}^* A \Psi_{\text{RFT}} = \Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is diagonal.
4.  **Sparsity**: Any vector $x_t$ generated by this system will have a sparse representation in $\Psi_{\text{RFT}}$ (only active modes are non-zero), whereas in FFT, the irrational frequencies $\phi^{-k}$ will excite all Fourier modes (Gibbs phenomenon/Leakage).

## 5. Experimental Verification

Run the benchmark to verify the theorem:
```bash
python tests/benchmarks/rft_wave_computer_demo.py
```

**Expected Result:**
*   **RFT**: Near-zero reconstruction error with $K$ parameters (where $K$ is the number of active modes).
*   **FFT**: High reconstruction error unless $N$ parameters are used (due to leakage).
*   **Time**: Requires $N^2$ parameters to model the dynamics.
