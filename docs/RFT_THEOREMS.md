# Core Theorems of the Closed-Form Φ-RFT

Let \(F\) be the unitary DFT matrix with entries \(F_{jk} = n^{-1/2}\,\omega^{jk}\), \(\omega=e^{-2\pi i / n}\) (NumPy `norm="ortho"`). Indices are \(j, k \in \{0, \dots, n-1\}\).

**Conventions.** Congruence mod 1 means equality in \(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\). Angles are taken mod \(2\pi\).

Define diagonal phase matrices
\[
[C_\sigma]_{kk} = \exp\!\Big(i\pi\sigma \frac{k^2}{n}\Big), \qquad
[D_\phi]_{kk}   = \exp\!\big(2\pi i\,\beta\,\{k/\phi\}\big),
\]
where \(\phi=\tfrac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}\) (golden ratio) and \(\{\cdot\}\) is fractional part.  
Set \(\Psi = D_\phi\,C_\sigma\,F\).

---

## Theorem 1 — Unitary Factorization
Since \(D_\phi^\dagger=D_\phi^{-1}\), \(C_\sigma^\dagger=C_\sigma^{-1}\), and \(F^\dagger F=I\),
\[
\Psi^\dagger\Psi = F^\dagger C_\sigma^\dagger D_\phi^\dagger D_\phi C_\sigma F = F^\dagger F = I.
\]
Thus \(\Psi\) is unitary. A vector multiply uses **\(\mathcal O(n\log n)\)** operations (one FFT + two diagonal multiplies).

**Inverse:** \(\Psi^{-1} = F^\dagger C_\sigma^\dagger D_\phi^\dagger\).  
In code (NumPy): `ifft(conj(C)*conj(D)*y, norm="ortho")`.

---

## Theorem 2 — Exact Diagonalization of a Commutative Algebra
Define Φ-RFT twisted convolution
\[
(x \star_{\phi,\sigma} h) \;=\; \Psi^\dagger\,\mathrm{diag}(\Psi h)\,\Psi x.
\]
Then
\[
\Psi(x \star_{\phi,\sigma} h) \;=\; (\Psi x)\odot(\Psi h).
\]
Hence \(\Psi\) simultaneously diagonalizes the algebra \(\mathcal A=\{\,\Psi^\dagger \mathrm{diag}(g) \Psi : g\in\mathbb C^n\,\}\), which is commutative and associative.

## Proposition 3 — Golden-ratio phase is not quadratic (thus not a chirp)

Let \(\theta_k = 2\pi\beta \{k/\phi\}\) and \(D_\phi = \mathrm{diag}(e^{i\theta_k})\).
If \(\beta \notin \mathbb{Z}\), then \(\theta_k/(2\pi)\) is not congruent mod 1 to any quadratic \(Ak^2 + Bk + C\). Hence \(D_\phi\) is not a quadratic-phase chirp \(e^{i\pi(ak^2+bk+c)/n}\).

**Proof (second-difference/Sturmian).**
Define the forward difference operator \(\Delta f(k) = f(k+1) - f(k)\) and second difference \(\Delta^2 f(k) = \Delta(\Delta f(k))\).
With \(d_k = \lfloor \frac{k+1}{\phi} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{k}{\phi} \rfloor \in \{0,1\}\),
\[
\Delta^2 \{k/\phi\} = -(d_{k+1} - d_k) \in \{-1, 0, 1\}.
\]
Assuming \(\beta \{k/\phi\} \equiv Ak^2 + Bk + C \pmod 1\) gives
\[
-\beta(d_{k+1} - d_k) \equiv 2A \pmod 1.
\]
Since \(d_{k+1} - d_k\) hits \(0, \pm 1\) infinitely often, we must have \(2A \equiv 0\), \(\beta \equiv 0\), and \(-\beta \equiv 0 \pmod 1\), forcing \(\beta \in \mathbb{Z}\) — contradiction. \(\blacksquare\)

**Edge case.** For \(\beta \in \mathbb{Z}\) this test is inconclusive; no chirp-equivalence is claimed. We neither claim nor require chirp-equivalence when \(\beta \in \mathbb{Z}\).

## Corollary 3.1 — Outside the LCT/FrFT (metaplectic) class

In the discrete metaplectic group (generated by \(F\), scalings/permutations, and quadratic-phase multiplications), the diagonal elements are exactly quadratic chirps (see standard treatments of the discrete metaplectic group / time-frequency analysis textbooks). By Prop. 3, \(D_\phi\) (with \(\beta \notin \mathbb{Z}\)) is not such a chirp; since metaplectics form a group and \(C_\sigma F\) is metaplectic, the product
\[
\Psi = D_\phi (C_\sigma F)
\]
is not metaplectic. Therefore \(\Psi\) is not representable as an LCT/FrFT.

**Scope.** We exclude only LCT/FrFT/metaplectic; other unitary families may share properties with \(\Psi\).

---

## Practical Tests (implemented in `tests/rft/`)
- **Round-trip:** \(\|x - \Psi^{-1}\Psi x\|/\|x\| \approx 10^{-16}\).
- **Commutator:** \(\|h_1\star(h_2\star x)-(h_2\star(h_1\star x))\|/\|x\| \approx 10^{-15}\).
- **Non-equivalence:** large RMS residual to quadratic phase; low max DFT correlation; high entropy of \(\Psi^\dagger F\) columns.
- **Sturmian Property:** `test_nonquadratic_phase.py` shows \(\ge 3\) residue classes for \(\Delta^2(\beta\{k/\phi\}) \pmod 1\) when \(\beta \notin \mathbb{Z}\).

### Historical Note
An earlier formulation built \(\Psi\) via QR orthonormalization of a phase kernel. See Appendix A for details and equivalence assumptions.

## Appendix A — Alternative Kernel-Based Formulation (Historical)
**Definition (Kernel Form).** Let
\[
K_{ij} = g_{ij}\,\exp\big(2\pi i\,\beta\, \varphi_i\, \varphi_j\big),
\]
with amplitude envelope \(g_{ij}\) and index embedding \(\varphi_k\) (e.g. \(\varphi_k = \{k/\phi\}\)). The transform was originally taken as
\[
\Psi = \mathrm{orth}(K)\quad (\text{e.g. QR, first \(n\) columns}).
\]

**Equivalence to Closed-Form.** Assume:
1. (Approximate separability) \(g_{ij} \approx g_i h_j\) with low-rank residual.
2. (Golden-ratio embedding) \(\varphi_i = \{i/\phi\}\) up to bounded perturbation \(|\delta_i| \leq \epsilon\).
3. (Singular alignment) Leading left/right singular vectors of \(K\) align (componentwise phase) with \(D_\phi\) and \(C_\sigma F\) columns.
Then after column normalization and global phase adjustment,
\[
\mathrm{orth}(K) \approx D_\phi C_\sigma F,
\]
with empirical Frobenius relative residual \(r_n = \|K - D_\phi C_\sigma F\|_F/\|K\|_F\) observed \(<10^{-3}\) for tested \(n\in[128,512]\). Formal bounds pending.

**Disclaimer (Empirical Status).** The above alignment and residual are currently empirical; a proof requires bounding SVD perturbations under near-separable modulation and low-discrepancy index embeddings.

**Practical Guidance.** For implementation and benchmarking use the closed-form \(\Psi = D_\phi C_\sigma F\): it avoids QR (\(\mathcal O(n^3)\) preprocessing), is numerically stable, and gives immediate \(\mathcal O(n\log n)\) apply complexity. The kernel view remains valuable for provenance and potential extensions (e.g. alternative envelopes \(g_{ij}\)).

**Future Work.** Provide explicit perturbation lemma: if \(\|g_{ij} - g_i h_j\|_F \leq \eta\) and \(|\delta_i| \leq \epsilon\), then derive \(r_n = \mathcal O(\eta + \epsilon)\). Document envelope choices and their spectral effects.
