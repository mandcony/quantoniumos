# Quantonium OS Security Hardening - Phase 4

## Container & Supply-Chain Security

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 4 of the Quantonium OS security hardening roadmap, focusing on container security and supply chain integrity.

## Overview

Phase 4 enhances the security of the Quantonium OS application by implementing container-level protections and supply chain safeguards. This phase addresses the following key areas:

1. Dependency management and vulnerability prevention
2. Container hardening and security best practices
3. Image scanning and vulnerability detection
4. Secure registry access and image signing
5. CI/CD pipeline security
6. Documentation and user guidance

## Implementation Details

### 4.1 Dependency Pinning

- All dependencies are now pinned to exact versions in pyproject.toml
- Updated from loose version requirements (>=x.y.z) to strict versions (==x.y.z)
- Added pip-audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
- Verified all dependencies are free from known vulnerabilities

### 4.2 Hardened Dockerfile

The project now includes a secure multi-stage Docker build:

- Reference Python base image by digest (sha256) to prevent supply chain attacks
- Implement multi-stage build with separate build and runtime stages
- Run the container as non-root user "quant" (UID 1001)
- Enable no-new-privileges via docker-compose.yml
- Set filesystem as read-only with explicit rw volume for logs
- Drop all capabilities except NET_BIND_SERVICE
- Add comprehensive health check

### 4.3 Image Scanning

- Integrated Trivy scanner in CI pipeline
- Added local scanning script (scripts/trivy_scan.sh)
- Configure to fail on HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- Generate vulnerability reports in trivy-reports directory

### 4.4 Registry Credentials

- Added GitHub Secrets for container registry credentials
- Implement container signing using Cosign with GitHub OIDC tokens
- Set up secure push to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

### 4.5 CI Pipeline Updates

The GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/secure.yml) now includes:

1. Lint Python code with flake8, black, and isort
2. Run security scans with pip-audit
3. Execute test suite with coverage reporting
4. Build and cache Docker image
5. Scan image with Trivy
6. Sign image with Cosign
7. Push to container registry

The pipeline fails if any of the following conditions are met:
- Code quality issues detected
- Dependency vulnerabilities found
- Tests fail
- HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities in container

### 4.6 Documentation

- Added SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure process and PGP key
- Updated README.md with Docker usage instructions
- Added verification instructions for signed containers
- Documented security best practices for container deployment
- Created scripts for local validation and verification

### 4.7 Validation

- Created container_validation.sh script to verify:
  - Container functions with --read-only flag
  - Application serves /api/health endpoint properly
  - Container runs as non-root user
  - Logs are written to the mounted volume
- Verified Trivy scan is clean
- Added Cosign signature verification script

## Security Benefits

The implementation of Phase 4 provides the following security benefits:

1. **Prevents Supply Chain Attacks**
   - Pinned dependencies prevent injection of malicious packages
   - Image digest verification ensures base image integrity
   - Signed containers prevent tampering

2. **Reduces Attack Surface**
   - Non-root user reduces privilege escalation risk
   - Read-only filesystem prevents runtime modifications
   - Minimal capabilities limit potential exploitation

3. **Enables Continuous Security Verification**
   - Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Consistent security checks before deployment
   - Early detection of security issues

4. **Improves Security Transparency**
   - Public security policy and disclosure process
   - Verification mechanisms for container integrity
   - Documentation of security measures

## Next Steps

With Phase 4 complete, the next phase will focus on runtime container hardening and sandbox profiles:

- SELinux/AppArmor policies
- Seccomp profiles
- Memory and CPU resource limits
- Advanced runtime integrity monitoring
