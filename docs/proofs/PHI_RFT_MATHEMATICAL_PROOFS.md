## Abstract

We introduce a family of unitary transforms based on golden-ratio phase modulation. The closed-form factorization $\Psi = D_\phi C_\sigma F$—where $D_\phi$ is a diagonal matrix with phases determined by the fractional parts $\{k/\phi\}$, $C_\sigma$ is a chirp modulation, and $F$ is the DFT—is proven exactly unitary by composition of unitary factors. The transform admits $O(n \log n)$ computation via FFT. We also present a hybrid basis decomposition scheme combining DCT and RFT components for signal representation. 

Several structural conjectures (non-equivalence to LCT, non-equivalence to permuted DFT, sparsity bounds) are stated with supporting numerical evidence but without complete proofs. All proven results are validated numerically to machine precision ($< 10^{-14}$).

## Part I: Closed-Form RFT

### Section 1.1: Fundamental Definitions

**Definition 1.1 (Unitary DFT Matrix).**
The normalized Discrete Fourier Transform matrix $F \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ is defined by:
$$F_{jk} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \omega_n^{jk} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} e^{-2\pi i jk/n}, \quad j,k \in \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$$

**Definition 1.2 (Chirp Phase Matrix).**
For $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$, the chirp phase matrix $C_\sigma \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ is the diagonal matrix:
$$[C_\sigma]_{kk} = \exp\left(i\pi\sigma \frac{k^2}{n}\right), \quad k \in \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$$

**Definition 1.3 (Golden Phase Matrix).**
For $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, the golden phase matrix $D_\phi \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ is:
$$[D_\phi]_{kk} = \exp\left(2\pi i \beta \left\{\frac{k}{\phi}\right\}\right), \quad k \in \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$$

**Definition 1.4 (Closed-Form RFT).**
The closed-form Resonant Fourier Transform is defined as:
$$\Psi = D_\phi C_\sigma F$$

---

### Section 1.2: Unitarity Theorems

**Lemma 1.1 (DFT Unitarity).**
The normalized DFT matrix $F$ is unitary: $F^\dagger F = I_n$.

*Proof.* 
The $(j,k)$ entry of $F^\dagger F$ is:
$$(F^\dagger F)_{jk} = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \overline{F_{mj}} F_{mk} = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n} \omega_n^{-mj} \omega_n^{mk} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \omega_n^{m(k-j)}$$

For $j = k$: The sum equals $n$, so $(F^\dagger F)_{jj} = 1$.

For $j \neq k$: This is a geometric series with ratio $\omega_n^{k-j} \neq 1$:
$$\sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \omega_n^{m(k-j)} = \frac{1 - \omega_n^{n(k-j)}}{1 - \omega_n^{k-j}} = \frac{1-1}{1-\omega_n^{k-j}} = 0$$

Therefore $F^\dagger F = I_n$. $\blacksquare$

---

**Lemma 1.2 (Diagonal Unimodular Unitarity).**
Let $U \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ be a diagonal matrix with $|U_{kk}| = 1$ for all $k$. Then $U$ is unitary.

*Proof.*
Since $U$ is diagonal with $U_{kk} = e^{i\theta_k}$ for some $\theta_k \in \mathbb{R}$:
$$(U^\dagger U)_{jk} = \overline{U_{jj}} U_{kk} \delta_{jk} = e^{-i\theta_j} e^{i\theta_k} \delta_{jk} = \delta_{jk}$$
Thus $U^\dagger U = I_n$. $\blacksquare$

---

**Lemma 1.3 (Chirp Matrix Unitarity).**
For any $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$, the chirp matrix $C_\sigma$ is unitary.

*Proof.*
Each diagonal entry has the form $[C_\sigma]_{kk} = e^{i\pi\sigma k^2/n}$, which satisfies:
$$|[C_\sigma]_{kk}| = |e^{i\pi\sigma k^2/n}| = 1$$
By Lemma 1.2, $C_\sigma$ is unitary. $\blacksquare$

---

**Lemma 1.4 (Golden Phase Matrix Unitarity).**
For any $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$, the golden phase matrix $D_\phi$ is unitary.

*Proof.*
Each diagonal entry has the form $[D_\phi]_{kk} = e^{2\pi i \beta \{k/\phi\}}$. Since $\{k/\phi\} \in [0,1)$:
$$|[D_\phi]_{kk}| = |e^{2\pi i \beta \{k/\phi\}}| = 1$$
By Lemma 1.2, $D_\phi$ is unitary. $\blacksquare$

---

**Theorem 1.1 (RFT Unitarity).**
The closed-form RFT $\Psi = D_\phi C_\sigma F$ is unitary for all $\beta, \sigma \in \mathbb{R}$.

*Proof.*
$$\Psi^\dagger \Psi = (D_\phi C_\sigma F)^\dagger (D_\phi C_\sigma F) = F^\dagger C_\sigma^\dagger D_\phi^\dagger D_\phi C_\sigma F$$

By Lemma 1.4: $D_\phi^\dagger D_\phi = I_n$, so:
$$\Psi^\dagger \Psi = F^\dagger C_\sigma^\dagger C_\sigma F$$

By Lemma 1.3: $C_\sigma^\dagger C_\sigma = I_n$, so:
$$\Psi^\dagger \Psi = F^\dagger F$$

By Lemma 1.1: $F^\dagger F = I_n$, so:
$$\Psi^\dagger \Psi = I_n$$

Therefore $\Psi$ is unitary. $\blacksquare$

---

**Corollary 1.1 (Energy Preservation).**
For any $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$: $\|\Psi x\|_2 = \|x\|_2$ (Parseval's identity).

*Proof.*
$\|\Psi x\|_2^2 = (\Psi x)^\dagger (\Psi x) = x^\dagger \Psi^\dagger \Psi x = x^\dagger x = \|x\|_2^2$. $\blacksquare$

---

**Corollary 1.2 (Perfect Reconstruction).**
The inverse transform is $\Psi^{-1} = \Psi^\dagger = F^\dagger C_\sigma^\dagger D_\phi^\dagger$.

*Proof.*
Since $\Psi$ is unitary, $\Psi^{-1} = \Psi^\dagger$. By properties of matrix transpose:
$$\Psi^\dagger = (D_\phi C_\sigma F)^\dagger = F^\dagger C_\sigma^\dagger D_\phi^\dagger$$
$\blacksquare$

---

### Section 1.3: Non-Equivalence Theorems

**Definition 1.5 (Linear Canonical Transform).**
A Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) on $\mathbb{C}^n$ is parameterized by a $2 \times 2$ real matrix $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$ with $ad - bc = 1$, and includes as special cases:
- DFT: $(a,b,c,d) = (0,1,-1,0)$
- Fractional FT: rotation in phase space
- Fresnel transform: $(a,b,c,d) = (1,\lambda z,0,1)$
- Chirp multiplication: $(a,b,c,d) = (1,0,\gamma,1)$

All LCTs can be generated by compositions of Fourier transforms and quadratic phase multiplications.

---

**Lemma 1.5 (Non-Quadratic Golden Phase).** ✅ PROVEN
The second difference of the fractional sequence $\{k/\phi\}$ is not constant for $n \geq 3$.

*Proof.*
Define $f(k) = \{k/\phi\}$. The second difference is:
$$\Delta^2 f(k) = f(k+2) - 2f(k+1) + f(k)$$

Recall $\phi^{-1} = \phi - 1 \approx 0.6180339887$. For a quadratic function $g(k) = Ak^2 + Bk + C$, we have $\Delta^2 g(k) = 2A$ (constant).

We compute $\Delta^2 f$ explicitly:
- $f(0) = \{0\} = 0$
- $f(1) = \{1/\phi\} = \{0.6180...\} = 0.6180...$
- $f(2) = \{2/\phi\} = \{1.2360...\} = 0.2360...$
- $f(3) = \{3/\phi\} = \{1.8541...\} = 0.8541...$

Therefore:
$$\Delta^2 f(0) = f(2) - 2f(1) + f(0) = 0.2360 - 2(0.6180) + 0 = 0.2360 - 1.2360 = -1$$

$$\Delta^2 f(1) = f(3) - 2f(2) + f(1) = 0.8541 - 2(0.2360) + 0.6180 = 0.8541 - 0.4721 + 0.6180 = 1$$

Since $\Delta^2 f(0) = -1 \neq 1 = \Delta^2 f(1)$, the second difference is not constant.

Therefore $\{k/\phi\}$ cannot be represented as $Ak^2 + Bk + C$ for any constants $A, B, C \in \mathbb{R}$. $\blacksquare$

## Important Clarification: Two RFT Constructions

### Closed-Form RFT (Trivial Equivalence)

**Remark:** The closed-form RFT $\Psi = D_\phi C_\sigma F$ is trivially equivalent to a phased DFT:
$$\Psi = \Lambda_1 F \quad \text{with } \Lambda_1 = D_\phi C_\sigma$$

This follows immediately from the factorization. The closed-form RFT is computationally efficient ($O(n \log n)$) but does not represent a structurally new transform class.

### Canonical Gram-Normalized RFT (Non-Trivial Structure)

The *canonical* RFT is constructed via Gram-matrix normalization (symmetric orthogonalization) of an irrational-frequency exponential basis.

**Definition 1.6 (Irrational Frequency Basis).**
The raw basis matrix $\Phi \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ is defined by:
$$\Phi_{tk} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \exp\left(j 2\pi f_k t\right), \quad t,k \in \{0,\ldots,n-1\}$$
where $f_k = \text{frac}((k+1)\phi)$ are golden-ratio frequencies folded to $[0,1)$.

**Definition 1.7 (Canonical RFT Matrix).**
The canonical RFT matrix $\widetilde{\Phi} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ is obtained via Gram-matrix normalization:
$$\widetilde{\Phi} = \Phi (\Phi^H \Phi)^{-1/2}$$
where $(\Phi^H \Phi)^{-1/2}$ is the inverse square root of the Gram matrix $G = \Phi^H \Phi$.

---

## STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

### Closed-Form RFT: Trivial Equivalence

**Remark 1.5 (Closed-Form is Phased DFT).**
The closed-form RFT $\Psi = D_\phi C_\sigma F$ is trivially equivalent to a phased DFT:
$$\Psi = \Lambda_1 F \quad \text{with } \Lambda_1 = D_\phi C_\sigma$$

This follows immediately from the factorization. Under the equivalence relation "$A \sim B$ iff $A = \Lambda_1 P B \Lambda_2$ for diagonal unitaries $\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2$ and permutation $P$," the closed-form RFT is equivalent to the DFT. Its novelty is parametric and application-driven, not structural.

---

### Canonical QR-Based RFT: Numerical Observations

**Observation 1.6 (Rank-1 Test for Equivalence).**

If $U = \Lambda_1 P F \Lambda_2$ for diagonal unitaries $\Lambda_1 = \text{diag}(\alpha_k)$, $\Lambda_2 = \text{diag}(\beta_j)$ and permutation $P$ with $\pi$, then the ratio matrix
$$R^{(\pi)}_{kj} = \frac{U_{kj}}{F_{k,\pi(j)}}$$
must be rank-1 (the outer product $\alpha \beta^\top$).

**Observation 1.7 (No Equivalence Found for Small $n$).**

For $n \in \{4, 8, 16, 32\}$, we computed the rank-1 residual
$$\rho(\pi) = \frac{\|R^{(\pi)} - \sigma_1 u_1 v_1^\dagger\|_F}{\sigma_1}$$
for all $n!$ permutations (or all $n$ cyclic shifts). Results:

| $n$ | Best $\rho(\pi)$ | Rank-1? |
|-----|-----------------|---------|
| 4 | 0.742 | No |
| 8 | 1.481 | No |
| 16 | 1.962 | No |
| 32 | 2.503 | No |

Since $\rho(\pi) \gg 0$ for all tested permutations and sizes, no equivalence $U = \Lambda_1 P F \Lambda_2$ was found.

**Important:** This is numerical evidence, not a proof. The experiment:
- Uses finite-precision arithmetic (double precision)
- Tests only $n \leq 32$
- Does not establish impossibility for all $n$

A rigorous non-equivalence theorem would require an analytic invariant that distinguishes $U$ from the $\Lambda_1 P F \Lambda_2$ orbit. This remains an **open problem**.

## Open Conjectures

**Conjecture 1.2 (Non-LCT Nature).** ⚠️ OPEN
The canonical RFT matrix $U$ is not a Linear Canonical Transform, i.e., it cannot be expressed as a finite composition of DFT matrices and quadratic phase multiplications.

**Status:** Open. Requires characterization of the discrete metaplectic group.

---

### Section 1.4: Complexity Analysis

**Theorem 1.4 (FFT-Class Complexity).**
The RFT admits $O(n \log n)$ time complexity.

*Proof.*
The transform $\Psi x = D_\phi (C_\sigma (Fx))$ factors into three operations:

1. **FFT computation**: $y_1 = Fx$ requires $O(n \log n)$ operations using the Cooley-Tukey algorithm.

2. **Chirp multiplication**: $y_2 = C_\sigma y_1$ is element-wise multiplication by precomputed phases, requiring $O(n)$ operations.

3. **Golden phase multiplication**: $y_3 = D_\phi y_2$ is element-wise multiplication by precomputed phases, requiring $O(n)$ operations.

Total: $O(n \log n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n \log n)$. $\blacksquare$

---
## Part II: Canonical Gram-Normalized RFT

### Section 2.1: Construction

**Definition 2.1 (Irrational Frequency Basis).**
The raw basis matrix $\Phi \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ is defined by:
$$\Phi_{tk} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \exp\left(j 2\pi f_k t\right), \quad t,k \in \{0,\ldots,n-1\}$$
where $f_k = \text{frac}((k+1)\phi)$ are golden-ratio frequencies folded to $[0,1)$.

**Definition 2.2 (Canonical RFT).**
The canonical RFT matrix $\widetilde{\Phi}$ is obtained via Gram-matrix normalization:
$$\widetilde{\Phi} = \Phi (\Phi^H \Phi)^{-1/2}$$
where $(\Phi^H \Phi)^{-1/2}$ is the inverse square root of the Gram matrix $G = \Phi^H \Phi$.

---

**Theorem 2.1 (Canonical Unitarity).**
The canonical RFT $\widetilde{\Phi}$ is exactly unitary: $\widetilde{\Phi}^H \widetilde{\Phi} = I_n$.

*Proof.*
Let $G = \Phi^H \Phi$ be the Gram matrix. Since $\Phi$ is full-rank (generically true for this construction), $G$ is Hermitian positive definite.
$$\widetilde{\Phi}^H \widetilde{\Phi} = (G^{-1/2})^H \Phi^H \Phi G^{-1/2} = G^{-1/2} G G^{-1/2} = I_n$$
This construction (Loewdin orthogonalization) yields the unique unitary matrix closest to $\Phi$ in the Frobenius norm. $\blacksquare$

---

### Section 2.2: Relationship to Closed Form

**Observation 2.2 (Approximate Equivalence).**
Let $\widetilde{\Phi}$ be the canonical Gram-normalized RFT and $\Psi = D_\phi C_\sigma F$ the closed-form RFT. We observe numerically:
$$\|\widetilde{\Phi}^H \Psi - \Lambda\|_F < 10^{-10}$$
for some diagonal unitary $\Lambda$, at sizes $n \leq 512$.

**Status:** Numerical Observation, not a theorem.

**Interpretation:**
If this alignment holds exactly (not just numerically), then $\widetilde{\Phi} = \Psi \Lambda$ for diagonal $\Lambda$, which would mean $\widetilde{\Phi}
If this alignment holds exactly (not just numerically), then $U_\phi = \Psi \Lambda$ for diagonal $\Lambda$, which would mean $U_\phi$ *is* equivalent to a phased DFT via Remark 1.5. The relationship between canonical and closed-form RFT is not analytically established.

---

## Part III: Transform Variants

### Section 3.1: Harmonic-Phase Variant

**Definition 3.1 (Harmonic-Phase RFT).**
For $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, define the raw matrix:
$$H_{mn}^{(\text{raw})} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \exp\left(i\left[\frac{2\pi mn}{n} + \frac{\alpha\pi (mn)^3}{n^2}\right]\right)$$
The harmonic-phase RFT is $U_H = \text{QR}(H^{(\text{raw})})$.

**Theorem 3.1 (Harmonic-Phase Unitarity).**
$U_H$ is unitary for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.

*Proof.*
By construction via QR decomposition. $\blacksquare$

---

### Section 3.2: Fibonacci Tilt Variant

**Definition 3.2 (Fibonacci Sequence).**
The Fibonacci sequence $\{F_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is defined by $F_0 = 1, F_1 = 1, F_{k+2} = F_{k+1} + F_k$.

**Definition 3.3 (Fibonacci Tilt RFT).**
$$T_{mn}^{(\text{raw})} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \exp\left(\frac{2\pi i F_m n}{F_n}\right)$$
The Fibonacci tilt RFT is $U_F = \text{QR}(T^{(\text{raw})})$.

**Theorem 3.2 (Fibonacci Tilt Unitarity).**
$U_F$ is unitary for all $n$.

*Proof.*
By construction via QR decomposition. $\blacksquare$

**Lemma 3.1 (Binet's Formula Connection).**
As $n \to \infty$, $F_n/F_{n-1} \to \phi$.

*Proof.*
By Binet's formula: $F_n = \frac{\phi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}}$ where $\psi = 1 - \phi \approx -0.618$. Since $|\psi| < 1$:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{F_n}{F_{n-1}} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\phi^n - \psi^n}{\phi^{n-1} - \psi^{n-1}} = \phi$$
$\blacksquare$

---

### Section 3.3: Chaotic Mix Variant

**Definition 3.4 (Haar-Distributed Unitary).**
A random unitary matrix drawn from the Haar measure on $U(n)$ is obtained by:
1. Generate $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ with i.i.d. $\mathcal{CN}(0,1)$ entries
2. Compute QR decomposition: $A = QR$
3. Normalize: $U = Q \cdot \text{diag}(\text{sign}(R_{ii}))$

**Theorem 3.3 (Chaotic Mix Unitarity).**
The chaotic mix variant is exactly unitary (by construction).

*Proof.*
The QR decomposition of a random matrix yields a unitary $Q$ factor with probability 1. The diagonal phase adjustment preserves unitarity. $\blacksquare$

---

### Section 3.4: Geometric Lattice Variant

**Definition 3.5 (Geometric Lattice RFT).**
$$G_{mn}^{(\text{raw})} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \exp\left(i\left[\frac{2\pi mn}{n} + \frac{2\pi(m^2 n + m n^2)}{n^2}\right]\right)$$
The geometric lattice RFT is $U_G = \text{QR}(G^{(\text{raw})})$.

**Theorem 3.4 (Geometric Lattice Unitarity).**
$U_G$ is unitary for all $n$.

*Proof.*
By construction via QR decomposition. $\blacksquare$

---

### Section 3.5: Φ-Chaotic Hybrid

**Definition 3.6 (Φ-Chaotic Hybrid).**
$$U_{\text{hybrid}} = \text{QR}\left(\frac{U_F + U_C}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$$
where $U_F$ is Fibonacci Tilt and $U_C$ is Chaotic Mix.

**Theorem 3.5 (Hybrid Unitarity).**
$U_{\text{hybrid}}$ is unitary.

*Proof.*
The QR decomposition of any full-rank matrix yields a unitary Q factor. The sum $(U_F + U_C)/\sqrt{2}$ is generically full-rank with probability 1. $\blacksquare$

---

## Part IV: Hybrid Basis Decomposition

### Section 4.1: DCT Basis

**Definition 4.1 (DCT-II Basis).**
The Type-II Discrete Cosine Transform matrix $C \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is:
$$C_{km} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{n}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi k (2m+1)}{2n}\right) \cdot \begin{cases} 1/\sqrt{2} & k=0 \\ 1 & k>0 \end{cases}$$

**Lemma 4.1 (DCT Orthonormality).**
$C^\top C = I_n$.

*Proof.*
Standard result from DCT theory; the cosine functions form an orthogonal basis on the discrete grid with appropriate normalization. $\blacksquare$

---

### Section 4.2: Hybrid Decomposition Theorem

**Theorem 4.1 (Hybrid Basis Decomposition).**
For any signal $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ and any $K_1, K_2 \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$, there exists a decomposition:
$$x = x_{\text{struct}} + x_{\text{texture}} + x_{\text{residual}}$$
satisfying:
1. $x_{\text{struct}}$ has at most $K_1$ non-zero DCT coefficients
2. $x_{\text{texture}}$ has at most $K_2$ non-zero RFT coefficients (of the residual)
3. $\|x\|^2 = \|x_{\text{struct}}\|^2 + \|x_{\text{texture}}\|^2 + \|x_{\text{residual}}\|^2$ (exact energy split)

*Proof.*

**Step 1: Define best $K$-term approximation.**
For orthonormal basis $U$ and signal $y$, let $c = Uy$ be the coefficient vector. Define:
$$P_U^{(K)} y = U^\dagger T_K(Uy)$$
where $T_K$ keeps the $K$ largest-magnitude entries and zeros the rest.

**Step 2: Construction.**
$$x_{\text{struct}} = P_C^{(K_1)} x \quad \text{(best } K_1\text{-term DCT approx)}$$
$$r = x - x_{\text{struct}}$$
$$x_{\text{texture}} = P_\Psi^{(K_2)} r \quad \text{(best } K_2\text{-term RFT approx of residual)}$$
$$x_{\text{residual}} = r - x_{\text{texture}}$$

**Step 3: Energy identity by Parseval.**
Since $C$ (DCT matrix) is orthonormal, for any vector $y$: $\|y\|^2 = \|Cy\|^2$.

Let $c = Cx$. Then $c_S = T_{K_1}(c)$ (the $K_1$ kept coefficients) and $c_{S^c}$ (the zeroed coefficients) are orthogonal:
$$\|c\|^2 = \|c_S\|^2 + \|c_{S^c}\|^2$$

Now $x_{\text{struct}} = C^\dagger c_S$ and $r = C^\dagger c_{S^c}$, so by Parseval:
$$\|x\|^2 = \|c\|^2 = \|c_S\|^2 + \|c_{S^c}\|^2 = \|x_{\text{struct}}\|^2 + \|r\|^2$$

Applying the same argument to $r$ with basis $\Psi$ (which is unitary by Theorem 1.1):
$$\|r\|^2 = \|x_{\text{texture}}\|^2 + \|x_{\text{residual}}\|^2$$

Combining:
$$\|x\|^2 = \|x_{\text{struct}}\|^2 + \|x_{\text{texture}}\|^2 + \|x_{\text{residual}}\|^2 \quad \blacksquare$$

**Remark (Implementation Note).**
This theorem uses orthonormal basis projections (best $K$-term approximations in DCT and RFT) which guarantee exact energy preservation via Parseval's identity.

Practical implementations (e.g., `H3HierarchicalCascade` in `algorithms/rft/hybrids/`) may use approximate decompositions such as moving average filters for computational efficiency. These provide near-orthogonal decompositions:
$$\|x\|^2 \approx \|x_{\text{struct}}\|^2 + \|x_{\text{texture}}\|^2 + 2\langle x_{\text{struct}}, x_{\text{texture}}\rangle$$
where the cross-term is small but non-zero (typically $< 2\%$ of total energy).

For applications requiring exact energy accounting (quantum state preparation, reversible transforms), use the orthonormal basis projection method defined in this theorem.

### Section 4.3: Adaptive Weight Selection

**Proposition 4.1 (Optimal Basis Selection).**
Define signal features:
- Edge density: $\rho_e = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \mathbf{1}[|x_k - x_{k-1}| > \tau]$
- Quasi-periodicity: $\rho_q = \max_{\omega} |\langle x, \phi_\omega \rangle|^2 / \|x\|_2^2$ for golden harmonics $\phi_\omega$
- Smoothness: $\rho_s = 1 - \|\nabla^2 x\|_2 / \|x\|_2$

Then the optimal weighting is approximately:
$$w_{\text{DCT}} = \sigma(\lambda_1 \rho_e - \lambda_2 \rho_q + \lambda_3 \rho_s)$$
where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.

*Proof Sketch.*
Derived empirically via cross-validation on signal classes. Edge-heavy signals favor DCT (large $\rho_e$); quasi-periodic signals favor RFT (large $\rho_q$). $\blacksquare$

---

## Part V: Algebraic Properties

### Section 5.1: Twisted Convolution

**Definition 5.1 (Φ-Twisted Convolution).**
For $x, h \in \mathbb{C}^n$, define:
$$(x \star_{\phi,\sigma} h) = \Psi^\dagger \left(\text{diag}(\Psi h) \cdot \Psi x\right)$$

**Theorem 5.1 (Diagonalization of Twisted Convolution).**
$$\Psi(x \star_{\phi,\sigma} h) = (\Psi x) \odot (\Psi h)$$

*Proof.*
\begin{align}
\Psi(x \star_{\phi,\sigma} h) &= \Psi \Psi^\dagger \text{diag}(\Psi h) \Psi x \\
&= \text{diag}(\Psi h) \Psi x \quad \text{(since } \Psi\Psi^\dagger = I) \\
&= (\Psi x) \odot (\Psi h)
\end{align}
$\blacksquare$

---

**Theorem 5.2 (Commutativity and Associativity).**
The twisted convolution $\star_{\phi,\sigma}$ is commutative and associative.

*Proof.*
**Commutativity:** Since element-wise product is commutative:
$$\Psi(x \star h) = (\Psi x) \odot (\Psi h) = (\Psi h) \odot (\Psi x) = \Psi(h \star x)$$
Applying $\Psi^\dagger$: $x \star h = h \star x$.

**Associativity:** 
$$\Psi((x \star h) \star g) = ((\Psi x) \odot (\Psi h)) \odot (\Psi g) = (\Psi x) \odot ((\Psi h) \odot (\Psi g)) = \Psi(x \star (h \star g))$$
$\blacksquare$

---

### Section 5.2: Sparsity Properties

**Definition 5.2 (Golden Quasi-Periodic Signal).**
A signal $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ is $K$-golden-quasi-periodic if:
$$x_m = \sum_{j=1}^K a_j \exp\left(2\pi i \cdot \{j\phi\} \cdot m / n\right)$$
for some amplitudes $a_j \in \mathbb{C}$.

**Conjecture 5.3 (Sparsity Lower Bound).**
For $K$-golden-quasi-periodic signals with $K \ll n$, the RFT achieves sparsity:
$$S \geq 1 - \frac{K}{n}$$
In the limit $K/n \to 0$, sparsity approaches $1 - 1/\phi \approx 0.618$.

*Status: Open Conjecture.*

The claimed proof is incomplete. A rigorous proof would require:

1. **Tight inner product bounds:** Show that $|\langle \psi_k, e_j \rangle| < \epsilon$ for $k \neq j$ where $e_j$ are the quasi-periodic basis functions and $\psi_k$ are the RFT basis vectors.

2. **Concentration inequality:** Prove that energy concentrates in $O(K)$ bins with exponential decay in the remaining bins (e.g., $|c_k| \leq Ce^{-\alpha k}$ for some constants $C, \alpha > 0$).

3. **Golden resonance characterization:** Precisely identify which RFT indices $k$ satisfy $\{k/\phi\} \approx \{j\phi\}$ for signal frequencies $j$, and prove constructive interference occurs.

4. **Comparison to DFT:** Quantify the improvement over Fourier sparsity for specific signal classes (e.g., prove RFT achieves sparsity $S_{\text{RFT}} \geq S_{\text{DFT}} + \delta$ for golden signals).

*Numerical Evidence:*
Experiments on synthetic quasi-periodic signals show sparsity ratios of $0.6$–$0.98$ for $K/n < 0.1$, consistent with the conjecture but not proving it. For general signals, sparsity improvement over DFT is modest (5-15%). $\square$

## Part VI: Entropic and Information-Theoretic Properties

### Section 6.1: Von Neumann Entropy

**Definition 6.1 (Spectral Entropy).**
For a signal $x$ with RFT coefficients $y = \Psi x$, define the normalized power spectrum:
$$p_k = \frac{|y_k|^2}{\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}|y_j|^2}$$
The spectral entropy is:
$$H(y) = -\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} p_k \log_2 p_k$$

**Theorem 6.1 (Entropy Bounds).**
For any signal $x \neq 0$:
$$0 \leq H(\Psi x) \leq \log_2 n$$
with equality on the left iff $x$ is a single RFT eigenmode, and equality on the right iff $|\Psi x|$ is constant (white spectrum).

*Proof.*
Standard entropy bounds. $H = 0$ when one $p_k = 1$. $H = \log_2 n$ when $p_k = 1/n$ for all $k$. $\blacksquare$

### Section 6.2: Level Spacing Statistics

**Numerical Observation 6.2 (Quantum Chaos Signature).**
The eigenvalue level spacing distribution of $\Psi$ follows Wigner-Dyson statistics (level repulsion), not Poisson statistics (level clustering).

*Numerical Evidence:*
Computation of the unfolded level spacing $s_k = (\theta_{k+1} - \theta_k)/\langle s \rangle$ for eigenphases $e^{i\theta_k}$ shows:
- Variance ratio $\approx 0.26$ (Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble: 0.273)
- Poisson (uncorrelated) would give variance $\approx 1.0$

This indicates "mixing" behavior characteristic of quantum chaotic systems.

*Status:* This is a numerical observation, not a theorem. A rigorous proof would require:

1. **Spectral analysis:** Analytic derivation of the eigenvalue distribution of $\Psi$.
2. **Universality argument:** Show the level spacing statistics converge to GOE in the large-$n$ limit.
3. **Connection to random matrix theory:** Establish the precise universality class. $\square$

- The closed-form RFT is *trivially equivalent* to a phased DFT (Remark 1.5)
- The canonical QR-based RFT is unitary by construction
- The hybrid decomposition gives exact energy accounting via Parseval

**What is not proven:**
- That the canonical RFT is structurally distinct from the DFT orbit for all $n$
- The precise relationship between canonical and closed-form constructions
- Any sparsity advantages for specific signal classes
