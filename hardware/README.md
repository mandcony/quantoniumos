## ARCHITECTURAL FEASIBILITY STUDY

Mandatory labels:
- **No silicon fabricated**
- **Performance based on simulation/synthesis only**
- **Not a claim of optimality**

This tree contains RTL/TL-Verilog/FPGA builds, testbenches, synthesis reports, and visualization tooling for the RFTPU.

### Subsections
- `hardware/rtl/` — RTL sources and architecture definitions (indexed; files may still live at repo root `hardware/` for compatibility)
- `hardware/simulation/` — testbenches and simulation harnesses (indexed)
- `hardware/architecture_docs/` — design docs, reports, and figures (indexed)
