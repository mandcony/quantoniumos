# QuantoniumOS Hardware Test Results
**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Environment:** Linux (Dev Container)

## 1. Standalone RFT Engine (`sim_rft`)
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

The standalone 8x8 RFT middleware engine was simulated with `iverilog`.
- **Tests Run:** 10 patterns (Impulse, Null, DC, Nyquist, Ramp, Step, Triangle, Hex, Single Peak, Two Peaks).
- **Verification:**
  - Frequency domain analysis performed for each pattern.
  - Energy conservation checked.
  - Dominant frequency identification verified.
- **Key Result:** "ALL TESTS COMPLETED!" verified in logs.

## 2. Unified Engine (`sim_unified`)
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

The unified stack (RFT + SIS + Feistel) was simulated.
- **Mode 0 (RFT):** ✅ PASS. Energy conserved.
- **Mode 1 (SIS Hash):** ✅ PASS. N=512 transform completed (Timeout fixed).
- **Mode 2 (Feistel):** ✅ PASS. 48 rounds completed, valid ciphertext (X-prop fixed).
- **Mode 3 (Pipeline):** ✅ PASS. Full integration verified.

## 3. Scope & Limitations
- **Feasibility Study:** This implementation demonstrates functional feasibility of the Φ-RFT architecture.
- **Transform Size:** Detailed visualization and standalone testing focused on the 8-point core. The SIS engine implements N=512, but detailed timing/throughput scaling analysis for $N \ge 256$ is not included in this report.
- **Performance:** This is a functional verification paper, not a performance characterization. FPGA resource utilization and max frequency analysis for large $N$ are reserved for future work.

## 4. Linting (`verilate`)
**Status:** ❌ **FAIL (Lint Errors)**

Verilator static analysis reported issues.
- **Errors:** 12 errors, 45 warnings.
- **Key Issues:**
  - `BLKANDNBLK`: Mixing blocking (`=`) and non-blocking (`<=`) assignments to the same variable (`idx`).
  - `BLKLOOPINIT`: Delayed assignment to array inside for loops.
  - `WIDTHTRUNC`/`WIDTHEXPAND`: Bit width mismatches in array indexing and arithmetic.
- **Action Required:** Clean up procedural assignments in `quantoniumos_unified_engines.sv`.

## 4. Synthesis (`synth`)
**Status:** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE / TIMEOUT**

Yosys synthesis was attempted.
- **Result:** Process started but timed out or did not complete successfully in the allotted time.
- **Logs:** captured in `hardware/test_logs/synth.log`.
- **Action Required:** Optimize synthesis script or increase timeout; investigate potential combinatorial loops causing hang.

## 5. Makerchip TL-V
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

- **File:** `hardware/rftpu_architecture.tlv`
- **Architecture:** 64-tile (8×8) RFTPU accelerator with NoC fabric
- **Features:**
  - Φ-RFT core with Q1.15 fixed-point kernels
  - 256-bit SIS digest computation per tile
  - Cycle-accurate 8×8 mesh NoC with wormhole routing (2-cycle hop latency)
  - H3 cascade routing support for multi-tile pipelines
  - DMA ingress with per-tile sample distribution
  - Topological memory for vertex-indexed digest storage
- **Testbench:** Makerchip-compatible with automated pass/fail
- **Pass Condition:** `*cyc_cnt > 100` cycles, no errors
