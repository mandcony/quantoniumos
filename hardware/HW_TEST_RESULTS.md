# QuantoniumOS Hardware Test Results
**Date:** November 19, 2025
**Environment:** Linux (Dev Container)

## 1. Standalone RFT Engine (`sim_rft`)
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

The standalone 8x8 RFT middleware engine was simulated with `iverilog`.
- **Tests Run:** 10 patterns (Impulse, Null, DC, Nyquist, Ramp, Step, Triangle, Hex, Single Peak, Two Peaks).
- **Verification:**
  - Frequency domain analysis performed for each pattern.
  - Energy conservation checked.
  - Dominant frequency identification verified.
- **Key Result:** "ALL TESTS COMPLETED!" verified in logs.

## 2. Unified Engine (`sim_unified`)
**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL / WIP**

The unified stack (RFT + SIS + Feistel) was simulated.
- **Observations:**
  - Simulation completes and generates VCD.
  - **Issue:** `[TB] TIMEOUT waiting for mode 0` observed.
  - **Issue:** Data output contains `x` (undefined) states (`data_out=...xxxx`).
- **Action Required:** Fix Mode 0 handshake and initialize registers to resolve X-propagation.

## 3. Linting (`verilate`)
**Status:** ❌ **FAIL (Lint Errors)**

Verilator static analysis reported issues.
- **Errors:** 12 errors, 45 warnings.
- **Key Issues:**
  - `BLKANDNBLK`: Mixing blocking (`=`) and non-blocking (`<=`) assignments to the same variable (`idx`).
  - `BLKLOOPINIT`: Delayed assignment to array inside for loops.
  - `WIDTHTRUNC`/`WIDTHEXPAND`: Bit width mismatches in array indexing and arithmetic.
- **Action Required:** Clean up procedural assignments in `quantoniumos_unified_engines.sv`.

## 4. Synthesis (`synth`)
**Status:** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE / TIMEOUT**

Yosys synthesis was attempted.
- **Result:** Process started but timed out or did not complete successfully in the allotted time.
- **Logs:** captured in `hardware/test_logs/synth.log`.
- **Action Required:** Optimize synthesis script or increase timeout; investigate potential combinatorial loops causing hang.

## 5. Makerchip TL-V
**Status:** ✅ **READY**

- **File:** `hardware/makerchip_rft_closed_form.tlv`
- **Features:**
  - Closed-form Φ-RFT Q1.15 kernels (Deterministic).
  - Fixed 8x8 SIS Matrix A (Deterministic).
  - RFT-SIS Stage with centered reduction and folding.
  - Pass condition gated on SIS digest validity.
