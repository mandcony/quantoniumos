## 1. Core Architecture (DESIGN TARGETS ONLY)

| Spec              | Value                                  | Status |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|
| Process Node      | TSMC N7FF (7 nm FinFET)                | Target |
| Die Size          | 8.5 mm × 8.5 mm (~72 mm²)             | Target |
| Active Logic Area | ~2.8 mm² (logic + SRAM)               | Target |
| Package           | 2.5D CoWoS-S with HBM2E                | Target |
| Total Pins        | ~800 (flip-chip, ~25 × 25 mm package) | Target |

The RFTPU organizes compute into an 8 × 8 grid of tiles connected by an on-chip
network, with off-chip memory provided by HBM2E stacks.

**Note:** These are architecture targets. Real implementation would require:
- TSMC N7FF PDK (NDA-protected, ~$100k+ license)
- Cadence/Synopsys EDA suite (~$500k+/year)
- Foundry shuttle or MPW run (~$50k-$500k)

## 2. Compute Resources

| Resource             | Count           | Description                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| RFT Tiles            | 64 (8 × 8 grid) | Canonical RFT core + SIS digest pipeline         |
| CORDIC Units         | 128             | 2 per tile (sincos + polar extraction)           |
| Complex Multipliers  | 64              | 4 DSP multipliers per complex multiply           |
| RFT Kernel ROMs      | 64              | 8 × 8 Q1.15 canonical RFT eigenbasis per tile    |
| **Synthesized Gates (per tile)** | **~24.5k** | Yosys CMOS4 mapping of 8×8 kernel core   |
| Estimated Total Gates| ~3.2 million    | Logic + control + on-chip SRAM macros            |

Each tile implements an 8-point canonical RFT core, fixed-point Q1.15 kernel
LUTs, and hooks into the on-chip topology and cryptographic subsystems.

---

## 3. Transform and Cryptographic Engines

| Engine           | Capability                                  | Frequency |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Canonical RFT    | 8-point real-only eigenbasis (per tile)     | 950 MHz   |
| Large RFT Block  | N = 64 expansion (for SIS hash precompute)  | 950 MHz   |
| RFT-SIS Hash v31 | N = 512 lattice-based hash, 256-bit digest  | 475 MHz   |
| Feistel-48       | 48-round stream cipher                      | 1.4 GHz   |
| H3 Cascade       | Hypergraph / topology accumulation fabric   | 950 MHz   |

The canonical RFT implements the real-only eigenbasis of a resonance operator
K = T(R_φ · d). The same hardware is reused for SIS hash precompute
and digest flows.

---

## 4. Memory Hierarchy

| Memory Type         | Capacity           | Purpose                        |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Tile Scratch SRAM   | 128 × 2 Kb = 256 Kb | Local working buffers         |
| Topology Memory     | 64 × 4 Kb = 256 Kb  | H3 vertex / digest accumulators |
| SIS A-Matrix Cache  | 2 × 256 Kb = 512 Kb | Lattice basis / A-matrix      |
| Total On-Chip SRAM  | ~1 MB               |                                |
| HBM2E               | 2 × 8 GB = 16 GB    | Off-chip sample / model data  |
| HBM2E Bandwidth     | ~460 GB/s           | 4 channels × 128-bit          |

On-chip SRAMs are sized for tile-local transforms, SIS state, and topology
aggregation; bulk datasets live in HBM2E.

---

## 5. Network-on-Chip (NoC)

| Spec           | Value                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Topology       | 8 × 8 2D mesh, wormhole routing    |
| NoC Frequency  | 1.2 GHz                            |
| Hop Latency    | 2 cycles                           |
| Max In-Flight  | 64 packets                         |
| Packet Width   | 256-bit digest + routing metadata  |

The NoC provides low-latency, high-throughput movement of RFT digests and SIS
state between tiles and off-chip interfaces.

---

## 6. Clock Domains

| Domain       | Frequency | Function                                |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `clk_tile`   | 950 MHz   | RFT cores, tile FSMs, DMA               |
| `clk_noc`    | 1.2 GHz   | Router / NoC fabric                     |
| `clk_sis`    | 475 MHz   | SIS hash pipeline                       |
| `clk_feistel`| 1.4 GHz   | Feistel-48 stream cipher                |

Clock domains are decoupled with appropriate CDC at tile/NoC and SIS/Feistel
boundaries.

## 7. Power Profile (ASPIRATIONAL TARGETS — NOT MEASURED)

| Mode          | Power   | Notes                                      |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| Peak Active   | 8.2 W   | All 64 tiles + SIS + Feistel active       |
| Typical Active| ~5.5 W  | 64 tiles active, staggered across cycles  |
| Idle          | 541 mW  | Clock-gated, power-gated SRAM where possible |
| Single Tile   | 85 mW   | Active; ~4 mW idle                        |

**⚠️ WARNING:** These are paper estimates, NOT measurements. Real power requires:
- Gate-level netlist from commercial synthesis
- Parasitic extraction from P&R
- Voltus/PrimePower analysis with switching activity
- Silicon measurements from fabricated chip

Without a real N7 PDK and EDA flow, these numbers are speculative.

## 8. External Interfaces

| Interface       | Spec              | Purpose              |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| PCIe Gen5 ×8    | CXL 2.0-ready     | Host command / DMA   |
| HBM2E           | ~460 GB/s         | Off-chip data        |
| Cascade Links   | 4 × LVDS          | Multi-die expansion  |
| JTAG            | IEEE 1149.1       | Test / debug         |
| Quad-SPI        | x4 SPI            | Boot / firmware      |

---

## 9. Performance Targets (UNVALIDATED ESTIMATES)

| Metric               | Target Value                              | Status |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| RFT Throughput       | 64 tiles × 8 samples × 950 MHz ≈ 487 Gsamples/s | Estimate |
| SIS Hash Rate (N=512)| ~225 M hashes/s                          | Estimate |
| Feistel Encrypt Rate | ~1.4 Gbit/s                              | Estimate |
| Round-Trip Latency   | ~12 cycles per 8-sample block            | Estimate |

**⚠️ WARNING:** These are architecture projections. Real performance requires:
- Timing closure at target frequency (PrimeTime sign-off)
- Gate-level simulation with back-annotated delays
- Silicon bring-up and characterization

The 950 MHz target is aspirational — no timing analysis has been performed.

## 10. Key Architectural Features

1. **Canonical RFT Kernel**  
   Real-only eigenbasis of the resonance operator K = T(R_φ · d),
   enabling unitary transforms without complex multipliers in the kernel ROM.

2. **H3 Hypergraph / Topology Engine**  
   Tiles can forward digests to neighbors (two slots per tile) to maintain a
   distributed, hypergraph-like accumulation of state.

3. **SIS-Backed Cryptographic Subsystem**  
   RFT-SIS hash and lattice structures provide a path to post-quantum-oriented
   security primitives on the same transform hardware.

4. **Diagonal Tile Activation**  
   Thermal and power-integrity management via staggered tile activation pattern
   to reduce localized hotspots and IR drop.

### Yosys Synthesis Results (December 2025)

The standalone 8×8 RFT kernel (`rft_kernel_v2005.v`) was synthesized with Yosys 0.33:

```
=== rft_kernel_8x8 (Canonical RFT 8-point transform core) ===

Gate Count (ABC CMOS4 mapping):
  $_AOI3_:   2,338
  $_AOI4_:     265
  $_NAND_:   8,451
  $_NOR_:    7,924
  $_NOT_:    2,821
  $_OAI3_:   1,708
  $_OAI4_:     465
  $_DFFE_*:    509  (registers)
  ─────────────────
  TOTAL:    24,481 cells

Architecture:
  - 8 parallel MAC units (16×16 → 35-bit accumulator)
  - 64-entry kernel ROM (Q1.15 coefficients)
  - 8-cycle latency per 8-sample block
  - Real-only kernel (no complex multiply needed)
```

**Extrapolation for 64-tile RFTPU:**
- Per-tile kernel core: ~24.5k gates
- 64 tiles × 24.5k = ~1.57M gates (kernel logic only)
- With control, NoC, SIS/Feistel: ~3.2M gates (architecture target)

### Cross-Validation Details (December 2025)

```
RTL vs Python Cross-Validation
============================================================
RTL outputs: hardware/tb/rtl_outputs.csv
Test cases: 15

  Test  0: PASS (err_real=0 LSB, err_imag=0 LSB)
  Test  1: PASS (err_real=0 LSB, err_imag=0 LSB)
  ...
  Test 14: PASS (err_real=0 LSB, err_imag=0 LSB)

Summary: 15/15 passed
✓ RTL implementation matches Python canonical RFT reference
  Hardware is cross-validated within ±2 LSB tolerance
```

The RTL behavioral model (Verilator simulation) produces **bit-exact** results
matching the Python reference implementation using identical Q1.15 fixed-point
arithmetic.

## 12. Known Limitations / TODOs

### RTL Warnings (Not Production-Ready)

- `rst_n`, `cfg_*`, `dma_*` signals are undriven in lint (need testbench)
- `BLKSEQ` warnings: blocking assignments in sequential processes should be
  converted to non-blocking (`<=`) for synthesis
- No formal verification coverage yet

### What We DON'T Have (Required for Real Chip)

| Missing Item | Why It Matters | Cost/Access |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| TSMC N7FF PDK | Standard cell library, timing models | NDA + ~$100k+ |
| Cadence Genus | Commercial synthesis, timing closure | ~$200k/year |
| Cadence Innovus | Place & Route, DEF/LEF | ~$300k/year |
| Synopsys PrimeTime | Static timing analysis sign-off | ~$150k/year |
| Cadence Voltus | Power analysis with parasitics | ~$100k/year |
| Mentor Calibre | DRC/LVS physical verification | ~$100k/year |
| StarRC/QRC | Parasitic extraction (SPEF) | Included w/ P&R |
| Foundry shuttle | MPW or dedicated run | ~$50k-$500k |

**Total estimated cost for real N7 tapeout: $500k - $2M+**

### Realistic Path Forward

1. **Open-source FPGA demo** (what we have):
   - `fpga_top.sv` targets WebFPGA (iCE40)
   - Can synthesize with Yosys + nextpnr
   - Real, testable hardware at ~12 MHz

2. **Academic/research tape-out**:
   - Apply for Efabless/Google MPW shuttle (free, uses SkyWater 130nm)
   - Or MOSIS/Europractice for older nodes

3. **Commercial tape-out**:
   - Partner with a company that has TSMC N7 access
   - Requires significant funding

## 13. What IS Actually Validated

| Item | Evidence | Files |
|------|----------|-------|
| **RFT algorithm correctness** | Python unit tests pass | `src/operator_variants.py` |
| **Unitarity** | Error < 1e-14 (machine precision) | `tests/test_operator_unitarity.py` |
| **RTL functional correctness** | Verilator sim matches Python | `hardware/tb/tb_canonical_rft_crossval.sv` |
| **Yosys synthesizability** | 24,481 cells (generic) | `hardware/synth/rft_kernel_v2005.v` |
| **FPGA demo** | WebFPGA top module | `hardware/fpga_top.sv` |

These are the honest, verifiable claims. Everything else is aspirational.
