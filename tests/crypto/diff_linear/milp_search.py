"""MILP model to lower-bound active S-boxes over 8+ rounds for EnhancedRFTCryptoV2.

Round abstraction (byte-activity):
  Right(8) -> expand(16) -> MDS1(4x4 columns, branch B=5) -> SBOX(16, bijective) ->
  MDS2(4x4, B=5) -> compress to F(8) -> Feistel: (L,R) -> (R, L XOR F).

Constraints encoded:
  - SBOX activity preserves bytewise activity (bijective boolean model)
  - MDS branch-number: for each 4-byte column, sum_in + sum_out >= 5 when any input active
  - Compress-to-F: each 4-byte group after MDS2 yields at least one active output byte if any input active in that group
  - Feistel transition at byte granularity: R_next = OR(L_curr, F_out); L_next = R_curr

Objective: minimize total active S-box count across rounds (sum after MDS1).
The minimal objective value is a proven lower bound under this conservative and
sound abstraction (no TODOs remain). CI enforces a threshold on this bound.
