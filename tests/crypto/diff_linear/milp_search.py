"""MILP model to lower-bound active S-boxes across rounds (approximate but structured).

State per round (16 bytes through S-box layer):
  state0 -> MDS1 -> state1 -> SBOX -> state2 -> MDS2 -> state3 -> next round state0

Constraints:
  - SBOX is bijective at byte granularity: activity in == activity out
  - MDS1/MDS2 use branch-number B=5 (AES-like 4x4 MDS):
      For each 4-byte column: sum_in + sum_out >= 5 if any input active
  - Feistel bridging: if any byte active after MDS2, at least one byte is active entering next round

Objective:
  - Minimize total number of active S-boxes across all rounds (sum of state1)
  - The minimum provides a lower bound; CI enforces this bound â‰¥ threshold
