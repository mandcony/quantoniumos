**⚠️  RESEARCH USE ONLY — NOT FOR CLINICAL OR DIAGNOSTIC USE  ⚠️**

This software is provided strictly for research, educational, and experimental
purposes. It has NOT been validated, approved, or cleared by any regulatory
authority (FDA, CE, etc.) for clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic use.

DO NOT use this software to:
  • Make medical diagnoses or treatment decisions
  • Process real patient data in clinical workflows
  • Replace validated medical devices or software

This package contains tests for medical/biomedical applications of RFT variants:

- Imaging: MRI, CT, PET reconstruction and denoising
- Biosignals: ECG, EEG, EMG compression and feature extraction
- Genomics: k-mer spectra, contact maps, sequence compression
- Security: Privacy-preserving hashes for clinical data pipelines
- Edge/Wearables: Low-latency compression for point-of-care devices

All tests use synthetic or public domain data for reproducibility.
Real clinical validation requires proper IRB approval and de-identified datasets.
