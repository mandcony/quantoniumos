QuantoniumOS Medical Applications Test Suite
=============================================

This package contains tests for medical/biomedical applications of RFT variants:

- Imaging: MRI, CT, PET reconstruction and denoising
- Biosignals: ECG, EEG, EMG compression and feature extraction
- Genomics: k-mer spectra, contact maps, sequence compression
- Security: Privacy-preserving hashes for clinical data pipelines
- Edge/Wearables: Low-latency compression for point-of-care devices

All tests use synthetic or public domain data for reproducibility.
Real clinical validation requires proper IRB approval and de-identified datasets.
